This is a long guide for all of the Buckeye faithful who intend to invade the beautiful city of Austin, TX, and would like some ideas of what to do, see, and eat.  I am also going to compare Ohio to Texas in my brutally honest ways and let you know what I've learned and what you can come to expect.

First, a quick background about your author:  I'm a Buckeye who graduated in June 2005 with a computer engineering degree after the best five damned years of my life.  I moved down to Austin a month later to work for one of the many high-tech corporations that litter the “Silicon Hills.”  I just moved downtown but have been in Austin for 14 months.  I love Austin and it is going to hurt me to leave this wonderful city, but I'm already planning my return and see no reason why I shouldn't spend the rest of my life here.  I like it that much.

Warning:  I may insult you, your friends, or your business.  I also cuss when I felt the need to do so.  You have been warned.

*Update 08.22.06:  WOW, I never expected this blog to get posted to so many forums and get the traffic I got.  Many were pleased, many were insulted.  I must say that most of the Texas fans are totally awesome and helped a ton with their comments.  I will be inserting edits and comments from them into the article.
Another thing - this is a guide written for OHIOANS.  Not for Texans.  I got more traffic from Texans than I did from Ohio, and many called me an idiot (or worse) for only recommending things like the gringo-style Tex-Mex.  Well this was for a reason!  Ohioans, for the most part, want to go to the enjoyable white-boy food.  It's a guide for a ton of choices on a three-day weekend from Ohio, and I believe I know my intended audience more than the Horns fans do.*

**Introduction – Keeping Austin Weird**

Much like Columbus, OH, it is the state capital, geographically equidistant to many other big cities in the state.  It is the “blue”, liberal area surrounded by a sea of red conservativeness.  Austin has an amazing blend of hippies, techies, Hispanics, and country folk spread across the area.

Although it is no longer a very small town, Austin still has a college town feel, with the University of Texas' campus just north of downtown.  You cannot go anywhere without seeing burnt orange and the Longhorn logo.  Professional sports are a mere afterthought compared to the collegiate scene here.  In fact, Austin is the city with the largest population and no pro sports team (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL).

Being a college town, there is no shortage of partying going on in this city.  Put simply – if you are living in Austin during your 20s or 30s and having a problem finding fun times and meeting people, there is seriously something wrong with you.

The Colorado River runs through Austin, and a series of dams and reservoirs were created in the 1930s to control the river's course through the city.

It's a bit similar to Columbus in those aspects, but the similarities end there.

“Keep Austin Weird” is an unofficial motto of the city.  This is a city that strives to support the local music scene and local eateries, and rebels wherever possible against corporate invasion.  ![](http://www.tylersaustin.com/images/content/KeepAustinWierdLogo.gif)I've never seen a city with so few McDonalds (but yes, they do exist).  The rallying cry to Keep Austin Weird became popular in the 90s when an influx of corporate retail displaced some local businesses.  True Austin-lovers support local business, and I expect you to do the same.

Austin is also known as The Live Music Capital of the World (official slogan).  This is due to having the most music venues per capita than any other U.S. City.  Back in the 70s, the city became a refuge of country and western musicians escaping the corporate clutches of the Nashville Country scene.  Willie Nelson might be one that comes to mind.  This may be a surprise to you, but most of the music is NOT country – it is rock.  See this link for an idea of upcoming shows in the city:  [Austin360.com's Upcoming Music Events](http://www.austin360.com/event/events/etc/event?fmainPage=fmainPage&txtkeyword=&category=3456%3AMusic&radDate=days&selNoOfDays=365&selNeighborhood=-1&selVenue=-1&hidActionName=SearchUserEvent&selCategory=3456&selSubCategory=Music)

Austin is also host to Austin City Limits, a massive annual music festival in Zilker Park, which is held the weekend following the big game this year.

About 25 minutes west of the city lies Lake Travis, which is a reservoir on the Colorado River.  [![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/lake_travis_view-thumb.jpg)](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/lake_travis_view.jpg)It is home to some amazing sights and real estate, in addition to one hell of a party scene at Devil's Cove and a bar named Carlos and Charlies.  Lake Travis is considered one of the clearest lakes in Texas.

I've already mentioned Silicon Hills.  Austin has an incredible amount of high-tech companies in the area, which includes IBM, AMD, Samsung, Dell (actually in Round Rock, TX), National Instruments, Freescale, Applied Materials, 3M... the list goes on.

Although many Austinites somehow have the audacity to complain that housing is expensive here (compared to the dot-com bust, I guess it is), it is DIRT CHEAP to live in this city.  Austin has a cost of living that is roughly 6% cheaper than the American average, according to ACCRA.org.

Austin is hot and humid.  There's no way around it – August and September are freaken hot, and I love it.  You may not.  Remember the Austin City Limits festival I mentioned?  Well, the Sunday of that weekend last year (Sept 25, 2005), it got to be 112 degrees.  I've never experienced anything like it in my life – and neither had most of the Texans!  So be prepared that it could happen.

OK, that's enough about the city. Let's get down to business.

**What to see and do (sober / mostly sober)**

Lake Travis

I'll put it nicely:  If you come to Austin for a 3+ day trip and don't at least go see Lake Travis, you are retarded.  There are sights, views, and activities that you simply don't have in Columbus.  [![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/lake_travis_view2-thumb.jpg)](http://ericg.net/galleries/eric/albums/boat_travis/IMG_0759.jpg)You can find one on the side here.

The Ohio State alumni organization is setting up activities to do in Austin.  On Friday, there's going to be a chartered boat on the Lake.  I am pushing hard for this.  You can find out more on the website at [www.gobucksbeattexas.com](http://www.gobucksbeattexas.com)

If you would rather do something such as rent jetskis or get your own boat, there are many rental places.  Some quick googling and you'll be on your way:
[google results for austin jetski rental](http://www.google.com/search?q=austin+jetski+rental&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) (FYI:  On Friday I'm renting a pontoon from [Daybreak Boat Rentals](http://austin.citysearch.com/profile/10221831/))

While you're on the Lake, there's a few places you'll want to check out.  The first is Devil's Cove.  Here's a picture of some of the partying that goes on there – on a good weekend, you'll see a whole lot more boats than this.  [![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/Devils_Cove-thumb.jpg)](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/Devils_Cove.jpg)  Everyone simply  drops anchor, ties their boats together, and madness ensues.  After about a dozen trips out here, I have some stories that rival my best (or worst) times in Columbus.

Another thing you can do on the Lake is check out Hippie Hollow, which is a the only nude public park in the area (and yes, people do hang out in the buff there).

My favorite bar on the Lake is [Carlos and Charlies](http://www.cncaustin.com).  It's a really big bar with plenty of room for eating, dancing, and of course, live music.  If you're looking for a bit more of an older crowd to get loose with, this is a great spot.  I've noticed that I see far more older women with fake boobs and rich men with big boats at this place than anywhere else I hang out in Austin.

[Google Map link to Carlos and Charlies](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=5973+Hiline,+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&ll=30.3865,-97.742615&spn=0.409293,0.732651&om=1)

It's important to note that there's a lot of money around the lake.  Because of that, the lake brings a different lifestyle component than in the other areas of Austin, which I'll get into.

Town Lake

OK, I admit it, I'm a fish and love water.  Town Lake is a reservoir on the Colorado River in downtown Austin.  [![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/ViewFromTownLake-thumb.jpg)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/ViewFromTownLake.jpg)The Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail is a 10.1 mile long trail in that goes around it downtown.  You can always find plenty of fit men and women running along it, as well as dog walkers and retirees enjoying their afternoon.  If you're one of the crazy ones who needs to go for a run before cracking that 8am Budweiser on gameday, this is where you want to go.

Additionally, Town Lake is a great place to rent a kayak, canoe or rowboat.  See [www.ci.austin.tx.us/parks/trails.htm](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/parks/trails.htm).  And [here's a great map of it all](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/parks/downloads/tlake_kiosk.pdf).

BATS!

Spanning Town Lake is the Congress Ave. Bridge.  Congress is a major, six-lane street that cuts through the middle of the city and leads to the Capitol.  ![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/Austin_Bats-thumb.jpg)In the summer, nearly 1.5 million Mexican Free-tailed Bats live under the bridge, and you can see them nightly from mid-March to November to head out and get dinner.  It's an amazing experience.

Now, you might be disgusted by all these bats, but I think it's beautiful – and don't forget that lots of bats means NOT lots of mosquitoes.  I'll take that deal any day.  They consume 10,000 to 30,000 pounds of insects every night.  Still hate bats?

[Here's a good spot to map to for the bats](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=200+S+Congress,+Austin,+TX+78704&ie=UTF8&om=1)

The Capitol

While you're on Congress checkin’ out the bats, you'll have a great view of the Texas State Capitol.  ![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/Texasstatecapitol.jpg)It's a great site, but is also symbolic of the overabundance of Texas pride:  the building is 15 feet taller than the National Capitol.  To me, this is an egotistical effort to display the state's independence and dominance over everything else.  Good for you, Texas; you build big building.

> Yep, that comment enraged lots of Texans.  And I stand by it.  But after some discussion on hornfans.com, I have conceded that the architecture is absolutely beautiful, and beats anything out of Ohio (especially Columbus).  But come on, why does it HAVE to be 15 feet taller than the US Capitol??

[Here's a link if you want to take a tour](http://www.tspb.state.tx.us/SPB/Plan/Tours.htm)

Barton Springs

Barton Springs – Did I mention that I like water?  Barton Springs are four natural springs in Zilker Park, but what I'm referring to is really the Barton Springs Pool.  This is a man-made swimming pool on the park grounds.  It costs about $3.00 to get in, and you can swim here year-round.  The water temperature is a bit less than 70 degrees year-round, so the water is COLD during the summer.  On a good day, you can see plenty of hot coeds hanging out here and catching some sun.  There's also a diving board!  Although I prefer to swim my laps in chlorinated water, this place is awesome.

[Here's a link with more info on Barton Springs](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/parks/bartonsprings.htm)

Biking

Since Lance Armstrong is from Austin, and it's hilly here, Austin has a very strong biking influence.  Bicyclists are everywhere!  Here are a couple sites where you can check out some routes and rent some bikes:

[AustinBikeRoutes.com](http://www.austinbikeroutes.com/)
[BicycleSportShop.com](http://bicyclesportshop.com/)

If mountain biking is more of your thing, google around and you'll find some good information too.  The Green Belt is popular.

[Austin Duck Tours](http://www.austinducks.com)

These tours rock because the vehicles go through both land and water.  Take a look at their photo album and you'll see what I mean.

[Alamo Drafthouse](http://www.drafthouse.com)

This is your version of Studio 35 in Austin.  ![](http://www.alltheclosefamily.com/alamologo.jpg)The downtown one always has a bunch of cult and foreign films and a good beer and food menu. They also have a number of specialty shows and film festivals.

[Google Maps of the Drafthouses](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=drafthouse+near+austin,+tx&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=30.266944,-97.742778&spn=0.204897,0.254402)

UT Tower

[![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/UT_Tower_in_Orange-thumb.jpg)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/UT-Tower-in-Orange.jpg)Tower infamous for the August 1, 1966 killings by student Charles Whitman.  [Here's a great article](http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/whitman/) if that interests you.

The tower's really nothing too special... ugly by day, looks great at night.  Kind of like your sister.

Here's an image of it after the championship...  you're no longer #1, kiddies!

UT Campus

In two words:  Major disappointment.  The big 3 in Ohio (Ohio State, Miami, and Ohio University) put this campus to shame.  There's no Oval, no Mirror Lake, no Buckeye Grove... nothing.  Just a tower.

> Comment from jg:
Although you're in good company not being excited about the Tower (J. Frank Dobie hated it; called for laying it on its side and planting vines along it, and characterized the top as a "Greek outhouse"), I still think it has a sort of charm and is an iconic building.... Texas' campus is more compact than Ohio State's, but it also has more architectural integrity (Ohio State has none, as far as I can tell).  I'll admit, the Oval and Mirror Lake are pretty in an English country village kind of way, but there's a lot to be said for the uniform nature of the buildings on Texas' inner campus (the old "40 Acres").  What Texas doesn't have is lots of grass and big trees, but that's a function of the climate.

I'll agree, and there's not much argument here.  The problem with the UT campus, and there's nothing they can do about it, is that it's a bit too close to downtown, and too compact because of that.  I was just surprised that there wasn't much to see when I moved to Austin, and should have explained better.

Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium

[![](http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/wp/Football/Stadium/Stadium_800x600.jpg)](http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/wp/Football/Stadium/Stadium_800x600.jpg)
[![](http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c80/MegaDittos/HDscoreboard2.jpg)](http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c80/MegaDittos/HDscoreboard2.jpg)Ugly popsicle stand.  They really need the upcoming renovations.  I guess I'm just spoiled though, having been in the Shoe over 30 times.

However, I'll give them this - the new scoreboard is [freakishly huge](http://www.texassports.com/webcam.html).  For a bit it was the biggest HD screen in the world, but rumor is that Japan is attacking back (don't they always?) with a bigger one.

> Update:  Allright, I pasted in a better picture of the new scoreboard.  Here's how it works:Blue: old Texas board
Red: Texas A&M board(s) (54x72 = 40x72 + 10x72 + 4x72)
Light purple: Arkansas (107x30) - Huskers (117x33) close enough to arkie's
Bevotron (134x55)
Note that the goal posts you see up close are the nearby ones, and the far away ones are simply dwarfed by this thing

- Where to eat

Oh God where do I start...  OK, well Texas brings 2 things:  BBQ and Tex-Mex.  After a year here, I can say that I'm pretty bored with the same ol' Tex-Mex, but I will NEVER tire of the BBQ down here.

I'll be honest – before moving to Texas, I'd never had brisket.  I'd been missing out!  Get BEEF BBQ, these people don't do pork.

**The BBQ**

[Rudy's Country Store & BBQ](http://www.rudysbbq.com)

Butcher Style BBQ, fast service, great fixins, and a tasty, fat-free sauce that has a powerful kick to it.  I personally like the chopped beef and brisket.  Get food up front and grab a picnic table inside or outside.

[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=5973+Hiline,+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&ll=30.3865,-97.742615&spn=0.409293,0.732651&om=1)

[The Salt Lick](http://www.saltlickbbq.com/)

Technically outside of Austin, about 30 minutes south of downtown, so this one's only for the car renters. Beautiful hill country drive. It is BYOB (they can't sell beer – it's in a dry county) and cash only.  Get the family style – you'll get plate among plate of the most amazing BBQ you've ever had.

Now, my dad's eaten a lot of ribs in his life, and he told me that these were the best ribs he's ever had.  I am more partial to the brisket.  The sauce is deadly, fattening, and unbearably good.  Best 20 dollars you've ever spent.

[Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=salt+lick+near+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&ll=30.313617,-97.891617&spn=0.409598,0.508804&om=1)

[Stubb's BBQ](http://stubbsaustin.com)

This is where the big Ohio State Party is on Friday night and Saturday before the game, so you'll get here.  Also a great metal venue!

Here's a link to the page about the Buckeye Bash:
[gobucksbeattexas.com/activities/friday.html](http://www.gobucksbeattexas.com/activities/friday.html) and [gobucksbeattexas.com/activities/gameday.html](http://www.gobucksbeattexas.com/activities/gameday.html)

and of course, [Google's Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=801+Red+River+St,+Austin,+TX+78701+(Stubb%27s+Bar-B-Q)&ie=UTF8&ll=30.268408,-97.736306&spn=0.025501,0.038538&om=1)

[The County Line Restaurant](http://www.countyline.com/index.asp)

Unfortunately, I still haven't been here, but it has family-style serving like Salt Lick.  One of my good friends likes it more than Salt Lick, which I find blasphemous.

> Comment from J.D... it really looks like I missed a good one and will have to check this place out:
*I honestly think you've done one hell of a job on the write up for the city, there's really hardly anything left to add, except there's a BBQ place for the downtown located folk called Iron Works on Cesar Chavez (aka 1st St) that for 10.99 you get a MASSIVE beef rib, sausage, and brisket with two sides.  Some of the better BBQ I've found within the close downtown vicinity.*
Thanks J.D!

**Tex-Mex**

[Trudy's](http://www.trudys.com)

Best in Town without a doubt.  Get the Mexican Martinis (I like to upgrade mine for just a dollar more to Sauza Commemorativo tequila – For just 8.75 you get an entire shaker worth of the margarita/martini mixture.  [![](http://smv.typepad.com/photos/austin/jan_06_007.jpg)](http://smv.typepad.com/photos/austin/jan_06_007.jpg)They only let you have two and then cut you off, so if you're planning on tying one on, get one from the bar, switch to beer for a while, then get your second one before you leave :)

Oh, and the Stuffed Avocado is TO DIE FOR.  Go to any Trudy's location, I personally like the one up north on Burnet.
[Map of all the Trudy's Locations](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=trudy%27s+near+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&om=1)

As a fun side note, bored kids with a mission often embark on city-wide trips to attempt to drink 2 Mexican Martinis (complete with shakers) from each Trudy's location.  Rarely do they succeed, but those who do can crown themselves Kings of Austin... at least for a night.

[Matt's El Rancho](http://www.mattselrancho.com)
The quintessential Tex-Mex place in Austin. It's been around for over 50 years and has strong margaritas!

> Funny comment from BeeGee (maybe I shoulda mentioned this):*
Matt's El Rauncho is to Mexican food what a raven is to a writing desk: a bad joke.  It's nasty.  It's terrifying.  Better to stay home and throw an El Patio tv dinner in the oven.  Poo.  Ick. Yuk.*

[Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=%22matt%27s+el+rancho%22+near+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&om=1)

[Chuy's](http://www.chuys.com)

Mulitple locations here, I personally find it overrated but always have great service and love the margaritas here the most.

[Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=chuy%27s+restaurant&ie=UTF8&near=Austin+TX&om=1)

[Iguana Grill](http://www.iguanagrillaustin.com)
This is out by Lake Travis.  Try the Top Shelf Margarita and enjoy the sunset to some live music on the lake.

[Oasis](http://www.oasis-austin.com/)

![](http://decker.typepad.com/photos/austin_images/oview1.jpg)Great views, they say it’s the best view in Austin, but the food isn’t up to par.  I prefer Iguana Grill.
 On your left is a pic of the view.
The story is that in the summer of last year, they were hit by lightning and the place caught on fire, knocking out half of the patio.  They're now back!

> Comment from Francisco, who was one of those who thought I should recommend the REAL deal Mexican places.  If that's what you want, let me know and I'll get you some maps:good write up but damn man, i'm mexican and sorry, all the mexican spots you picked are only for white folks and not that great by any means.  do you ever go east of 35?  not completely hating but any authentic mexican will tell you all your spots are over priced or geared for whitey.  not that there is anything specifically wrong with that but i wouldnt necessarily call it the best places to eat mexican food. actually, i definitely would not call them the best places to eat mexican food.  try south congress, cesear chavez, riverside late at night. that is the real deal.  just saying.

**Breakfast**

Austin has the coolest breakfast joints around.  These make ATX special:

[Magnolia Cafe](http://www.cafemagnolia.com)

Serve up some great chopped potatoes and some crazy dipping sauce I liked.  Two cool locations on South Congress and Lake Austin Blvd.  Migas and fresh squeezed OJ absolutely kick ass.  They also claim to have world famous pancakes.

[Mapper](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=cafe+magnolia&near=Austin+TX&ie=UTF8&om=1)

[Kerbey Lane](http://www.kerbeylanecafe.com)

Very popular, several locations, be ready to wait.  Breakfast all day, and by far the best pancakes in town if you ask me.  I loved the raspberry ones I recently had.  Migas are also ridiculous.

[Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=kerbey+lane+cafe&near=Austin+TX&ie=UTF8&om=1)

Breakfast tacos

Get em anywhere, my favorite are actually the chopped beef ones from Rudy's.  Breakfast tacos are a staple down here, I'd never even HEARD of em up in Ohio.

[Juan in a Million](http://www.juaninamillion.com)

Sorry, I haven't made it here yet...  It's on Cesar Chavez in East Austin. Popular with the college crowd. The owner, Juan, is always there to shake your hand, I guess.

> Comment from Charles:

*It would be a shame to miss breakfast at Cisco's Grill on the other side of 6th street. Migas and fajitas are recommended.*

Thanks Charles! 
And here's a comment from Mike:
*For bfast, I highly recommend Las Manitas Avenue Cafe on 3rd and congress, and El Sol y La Luna, and Guero's on south congress about a mile from townlake for mexican lunch or decenlty priced dinner.*

**Late Night Food**

On 6th street, you'll see the two main pizza shops, Rappolo's and Hoeks.  By your Ohio State standards, these places SUCK.   I like Hoeks because they play all sorts of death metal.

Katz's Deli is very good (especially at 3:00AM after getting kicked off of 6th street) but overpriced.
[Google Map to Katz](http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&hs=e9d&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=katz&near=Austin,+TX&radius=0.0&latlng=30266944,-97742778,12664093041541759178&sa=X&oi=local&ct=result&cd=1)

Also, Thai Passion can serve you up some SPICY food so that you drink tons of water and don't have as bad of a hangover the next morning.
[Google Map to Thai Passion](http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&f=l&q=thai+passion&near=Austin%2C+TX&btnG=Search+Businesses)

**Other**

If you are coming from Ohio to Texas looking for Italian, I will slap you.  And bring me down some Adriatico's and Fly-Pi while you're at it!  And Mama Santa's if you're up in Cleveland.

Burgers – Do yourself a favor and stick with Thurman's in Columbus (and please oh please bring me a Thurmanburger!)... but if you must have a Burger, go to [Hut's Hamburgers](http://hutshamburgers.citysearch.com) on 6th street, this is a few blocks from where I live.  Greasy and lots of options.  [Map it](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=hut%27s+hamburgers+near+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&ll=30.284567,-97.742615&spn=0.20486,0.193291&om=1)

Coffee is real big, I like [Mozart's Cafe](http://www.mozartscoffee.com) (warning: aggravating flash site) a lot on Lake Austin Blvd.. good to bring a board game to.  [Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=mozart%27s+near+austin,+tx&ie=UTF8&ll=30.305762,-97.770081&spn=0.102408,0.096645&om=1)

Korean – I like Korea House, it's the real deal.  I hear it has good sushi too, but I don't order Sushi from Korean spots.  Impossible to find though.  [Google map..  good luck](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=korea+house+near+austin,+tx&ie=UTF8&ll=30.369617,-97.742615&spn=0.204683,0.193291&om=1)

**Partytime!!**

Allright allright, time to let loose!  You're a Buckeye, you can drink with the best of em.  You've drank a case and a half of beer in Columbus in a single day and lived to tell the story (yes, I've done this)...  you've downed beers and done 50 pushups at 8am for a 3:30pm game... you still have your shirt from Senior Crawl – so WHERE DO WE PARTY?
The best way to shake down the party scene is to break it into areas, and you can decide what you want to check out from there.
That said, let's get to the meat:

**Tailgating**

Well, first off, I'll give more pimpage to the party we're having at Stubb's BBQ.  I plan on being there on Saturday with my friends for a while.
[www.gobucksbeattexas.com gameday](http://www.gobucksbeattexas.com/activities/gameday.html)

After Stubb's at 3pm, you can go to the Buckeye Bash.  Since not all of my friends are in the alumni organization and we're going to opt for some crazier stuff, we might also just invade some other tailgates I know of.

[![](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/UT_Tailgating-thumb.jpg)](https://www.mikeroberto.com/Austin_Guide/UT_Tailgating.jpg)Here’s a map of the tailgate scene at UT.  When I went here, I was very new to Austin and didn’t know my away around, but this is the way I understand it:

One area is by Congress and E. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd, the other is at San Jacinto and Martin Luther King Jr.  These are off-campus, so there’s drinking.  When I was last there, it seemed pretty lax.  I have no clue what I’ll do, but I might bring some beer and cups and money and see what kind of (friendly) damage I can do with my friends.

By the stadium and I-35 is the old alum area.  I don’t know what goes on here, but I imagine it’s old alum stuff.

Here’s the [Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Austin,+TX+(austin)&ie=UTF8&t=h&om=0&ll=30.281676,-97.733881&spn=0.006004,0.010986) in case you want to plot your directions from Stubb’s or something:

OK, now time for the nightlife!

**6th Street**

Bar after bar after bar.  Tons of fun, the college kid scene.  Although I'm 24 and starting to feel a bit old around these parts, we keep ending up on 6th when we go out.  Wild times for sure, I guarantee it will be a total zoo on the big weekend.

Most places are 21+.  If there’s high interest, I’ll do some snooping around and find you youngins (and pedophiles) an 18+ listing.

The street gets closed down on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, so you can walk in it and barhop (covers are pretty non-existent in Austin, totally awesome).  No public container though, this isn't Beale St. (Memphis) or Duval (Key West).  It's better.

Also, first realize my style – I hate dressing up, and I don't dance much.  Although I prefer older women (not ashamed to admit), 6th brings the younger crowd.  I like wearing dirty jeans and flip-flops and a t-shirt.  The bars that I'm going to recommend here are just those style.  I'll try my best to accommodate everyone later on

Buffalo Billiards – if you want a chill atmosphere to shoot pool, shuffleboard, toss some darts, and rock the foosball table, this is your spot.  Right on the edge of 6th street.

On google maps, I'll link you here first, and you can figure out the rest yourself with the map that follows:

[Start here for 6th](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=201+E+6th+St,+Austin,+TX&ie=UTF8&om=1)

[Here's a good map to follow for the rest](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/downtown/e6th_200.htm)

PS – There's a dance spot upstairs above Buffalo Billiards that you can go club at.  It's not bad, you need to go into Buffalo Billiard's to get at it.

Logans - This place is across from Buffalo Billiards, and I hate it because the music is unbearably loud there.  The reason I bring it up is because they stop the music every now and then to play a funny movie clip or something from SNL (such as the Cowbell Skit), so that's something different

Friends and Spilz and Exodus – These places suck, but if you want to dance on 6th, you can do it here.  Kind of the trashier dance spots.  Exodus is 18+, I’ve never been there.

Bar Celona – Dancing downstairs

[![](http://www.johnnyroadtrip.com/cities/sanantonio/images/chugginmonkey.jpg)](http://www.johnnyroadtrip.com/cities/sanantonio/images/chugginmonkey.jpg)Chuggin Monkey – Get the Wet Banana shot.  I like this place, small little dance floor up in the corner.  Music's too loud, like most places on 6th.

B.D. Riley's – Irish bar that always has some sort of crazy band playing some sort of music that I can't classify because I'm a metalhead.  Pretty cool spot.

Dizzy Rooster – Girls will be dancing on the bar by the end of the night.  Popular because of the Real World, thus, I never go there.

Shakespeare's – By far my favorite bar on the strip, I really don't know why.  I just like the brick wall and all the areas in the back (nice patio back there with trees around you).  Cheap and friendly... I once said something to a barmaid that should have gotten me thrown onto the street and beaten to a pulp... but instead they welcomed me back in the very next night.

Maggie Mae's / Blind Pig -  I lump these together because they're the best spots to drink on an upstairs porch under the moonlight, and they'll have music downstairs.  They're next to each other.

I prefer Blind Pig.  ![](http://mikuna.image.pbase.com/u/wyk/small/52980.Scan2148.jpg)However, I just met an upstairs Maggie Mae's bartender from Wisconsin who said she'll be cheering hard for us and her and her UT friend are going to serve with two signs – hers will say “THIS LINE IF YOU SAY 'YOU GUYS'”, and her UT friend will have a sign saying “THIS LINE IF YOU SAY 'Y'ALL'” -- kinda a cool idea, I'll have to check it out and see if they really do that.

The Aquarium – Great place to get started, ALWAYS an abundance of hotties in here for whatever reason.  Great prices, I seriously think the bartenders purposefully forget to add all drinks to your tab.

The Library – Best place to drink cheap during the week, not sure about the weekend though.  Next to Aquarium.

Treasure Island – This place attracts some trash, but I must give it props because we've had two of the best going-away parties here in the history of Austin.  One of them was during my job interview, where the guys got so drunk that they ended up pouring beer all over themselves – and myself – right in front of my hiring managers.  Needless to say, the offer was in the mail two weeks later.

Agave – If at all possible, go to the back bar with a bunch of friends and get the Flaming Dr. Pepper – they might not allow you to if it's crowded because it's now banned, but it's worth a shot.  The big, black bartender does some of the most wicked stuff ever (last football season, he'd blow the flame off of his flaming, alcohol-soaked index and pinky fingers while making the hook-em horns sign... wow)

Cheers shot bar – College Station (Texas A&M) has far better shot bars, but I guess I'll point this one out because we're not used to shot bars up in the OH.

Pete's Piano Bar – expensive, but entertaining as hell.  ![](http://a1916.g.akamaitech.net/7/1916/33/7bffa240e4fb9a/images.citysearch.com/profile/62/b9/10206292p1.jpg)  Your typical piano bar with funny musicians and all.  Quite a unique crowd always comes in.

I never make it any more east than that usually when hitting 6th, since I live closer to the West side of 6th.  However, to get to Stubbs, we'll need to venture more east.

Man, I feel like letting loose just writing about this, and I don't even party close to as much as I used to at OSU.

**The Lake Scene**

I've already mentioned Carlos and Charlies.  This is great stuff, but if you're looking for a place to party at night, stick with us downtown.  Maybe party at the lake Friday during the day, which is what I'm doing with my friends.

**Red River**

This is your metal/alternative/grungy scene.  Although I'm a metalhead, this isn't where I hang.  Emo's rules, but I don't know much about the other bars.  Oh, and check out Stubbs ;-)

**The Warehouse District**

OK, so you want to dress up and hit a club, and you're not too happy with the Berto offering so far.  I'll try my best to make you coat-wearing, shiny shoe losers happy.

Still a relatively young crowd, but a bit older than 6th.  This area is centered around 4th street (yes, that's a whopping 2 blocks south from 6th).  Be prepared to spend more than me and my cohorts on 6th.

For reference, we'll be using this map a lot:  [6street.com/6s_warehouse_directory.htm](http://www.6street.com/6s_warehouse_directory.htm)

Red Fez – One of my favorites in this area, there's always a good DJ and a small area to dance.  Also plenty of places to sit if that's your thing.

Cedar Street – Popular for their Wednesday night showings of The Spazmatics (geeky manufactured 80s music which is always fun), I'm not sure what this place is up to on weekends, but I'm sure there's live music.  Outdoor area sandwiched between two indoor bar areas, my tabs are always more than I like here.

Lucky Lounge – All I know is that the last time I was here, I ended up running into a bachelorette party upstairs and some completely shameless times ensued.  So it makes my list.

Vicci – The most upscale dance place.  No flip-flops, wear a collar.  Five dollar cover, girls dancing in cages.  If you're from Ohio and you're traveling 1300 miles for a football game, you do not want to be here.  Fuck this place.  And that's all I have to say about that.

Whiskey Bar – This place is an alternative mix, probably more gays than other places around, but I like it anyway.  Thursday night specials to midnight are always good.

*New Bar updated 08.28.06* - Ginger Man - Right behind Whiskey Bar, this is on 4th and Lavaca and has an incredible beer selection on tap.  I can't believe I've been here a year and live three blocks from it and have never been here.  Tons of room out back with picnic tables, not too loud, casual crowd.  This place is amazing and I will go to it more often.  I've missed out!
[gingermanpub.com](http://www.gingermanpub.com/austin/a-frame.html)

Six – NOT on 6th Street, but located on 4th and Colorado.  Lance Armstrong opened this bar up after his 6th Tour de France destroyal – hence the Six – but after kicking French ass again, he kept the name Six.  Good patio upstairs, cool stair design inside.

Fado Irish Pub – I like this place, a good big Irish pub...  nothing much more to say than that.  Not a regular there.

Lavaca Street Bar – Sports bar that I've not gone to.  Oops!

Cuba Libre – WOW, get the mojitos, best in town!  They come with a sugary bamboo stick you can chew on too.

Apple Bar – I recently went to this bar and enjoyed the drinks.  It's not too big, but they had a pretty groovin rock band upstairs.

**The West End Market District of 6th­­ (where I live)**

OK, I see that you need something a touch more chill, you don't want to hang out with rowdy 21 year olds on 6th or dance to house music in the Warehouse District.  Well, let's head back to my area...  (these are also on the Warehouse map, just up north and west – a 10 minute walk from the main strip on 6th Street).  I'm really happy to live in this area.

[Little Woodrow's](http://www.littlewoodrows.com/) -  ![](http://www.classiccitybrew.com/austin_littlewoodrows.jpg)Literally in my backyard, I freaken love this place.  ONLY beer and good looken women working there.  Lots of outdoor seating, good happy hours, great selection of taps.  Old school and proud.  Additionally, the bar used to be named Woodie's! (close enough)

PS:  They don't serve food here, so feel free to order a pizza

[Mother Egan's](http://www.motheregansirishpub.com) – Irish pub with something fun always happening, such as trivia contests or live music.

[Opal Divine's Freehouse](http://www.opaldivines.com/freehouse/index.htm) – Opal Divine's serves my favorite bar food around, and has a cool outdoor sit-down area around the outside.  Very popular fruity tequila and margarita drinks, but you'd have to ask which ones are most popular.  I hear they have one of the best scotch and cigar selections in town.

Star Bar / Molotov – I never go to these, as I would rather hit the above three, but these are in the area and are good, chill bars that are a bit trendier for an older twenties / early thirties crowd.  Molotov has a very nice porch for good happy hours.

**South Congress**

I don't know this area as well as I should, but if you're south of the river on Congress, this is the “SoCo” area.  Lots of hip spots, but the only real good place I know to go drink is at a dive bar called Ego's – which has no ego at all!

> Allright, Brian added some great comments:
*As a 5th generation Austinite, i have to say great write up... as far as BBQ downtown everyone needs to do themselves a service and go to Iron Works, your mind will be blown away.
Here is my South Congress write up:
tons of Austin owned shops, plenty of restaunts, boutiques, and dives. Here are my favorites.
Home Slice Pizza: the best pie in Austin... and I think you would agree.
Doc's Motorworks: great little bar with an awesome vibe... i only go on Thursdays so their prices maybe a little high.
Threadgill's: awesome downhome food with an "Austin-tacious" band usually on the bill. Old home of Armadillo World Headquarters... the place where Willie started his hippie vibe and many came to follow.*
Thanks Brian!

**Where's the Browns Backer's Bar for Sunday?**

[Aussie's](http://www.aussiesbar.com) Baby!!
[Map to Aussies](http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&rls=en&q=aussies%20near%20Austin%2C%20TX&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl)

**Q:  Hey Berto, I want to salsa dance while down there... what do you have?**

A:  I have no clue, but try [Copa Bar and Grill](http://www.copabarandgrill.com/flash.html)
I doubt any Ohioans want salsa.

**So where's the country?**

Askin the wrong dude, but here's what I can dig up:

- [The Broken Spoke](http://www.brokenspokeaustintx.com)

[Midnight Rodeo](http://www.midnightrodeoaustin.com) – this is a bit of a drive off, and Thursday night is the popular night.  I hope to not go there again.

At this point, I'm spent.  I'm sure I missed plenty of stuff.  If you can't find something that suits your needs, hit up google, or just go to 6th Street and latch on to a big group of Buckeyes somewhere.

**Where to Stay**

Haha I'll put it nicely... if you haven't booked yet and want to stay somewhere close to the action, you're shit outta luck.  Start [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=hotels+near+2100+San+Jacinto+Blvd.,+Austin+TX+78712&ie=UTF8&om=1
) and work the phones outward:

**Driving**

So you're renting a car?  Cool, you can definitely check out the lake and Salt Lick and such.  Now some warnings:

- You are going to get lost, and get lost often.  It took me a good two weeks to figure this Austin thing out.  The cool thing is that many exits have Texas U-Turns, so you can just get off and just as quickly get back on in the other direction.

- Many of the highways have access roads, and this is where everything's located.  This often confuses google maps. 

In Ohio, you get off an exit, wait at a light, then make a turn and find your restaurant or whatever.

In Texas, more often than not, you get off TOWARDS an exit, find yourself on the access road (also called frontage road or feeder road), and then the restaurant is on that access road.  I personally like this, but many newcomers don't.

- There's tons of bridges in Austin, everything is elevated.  The design is quite nice but there's a lot of construction going on.

- Traffic isn't at nightmare status, but it's not painless, especially at the wrong times.  I-35 just plain sucks.  The fact is that this city is growing so fast that the planners can't keep up with the growth.

*** Drivers in Texas are SLOW.  PAINFULLY, DREADFULLY SLOW.  It's unbelievable.  Be prepared to merge onto a highway with a 65mph speed limit while you're stuck behind some fucking loser going 35 mph.  Happens to me every day, I swear to you.  Part of this is due to the roads being elevated, so they accelerate slower – part of it is due to the ridiculously slow driving in Texas.

In Ohio, 65mph speed limit means to go 72, 73... and get out of the way for the fast drivers in the left lane.  In Austin, 65mph means to go 55 in the right lane, 60 in the middle lane, and MAYBE, just maybe if you're lucky, 65 in the left lane.  This obviously doesn't help the traffic situation.

By far my biggest pet peeve in Austin... bunch of wimps on the road.  Just wait until you're stuck behind some loser in a Volkswagen with a bunch of lame bumper stickers clogging up the road.  Drives me nuts.  And don't even get me started on those bumper stickers.

**Public Transport and Taxi Cabs**

I've been on two buses since moving here, and one was to get from downtown to the tailgating areas near the stadium.

[www.capmetro.org](http://www.capmetro.org/)

Here's some cab numbers for you – don't drink and drive please:

American Yellow Checker Cab (512.452.9999) and Roy's Taxi (512.482.0000).

**The People**

I've been wanting to write this for quite some time.  Warning:  If you don’t like strong stereotyping, then skip this section.

I have found that, on average, if you meet a random person in Austin, TX (or Texas in general) and a person from Columbus, OH (or central Ohio), the Texan is FAR more likely to be a good, nice person.

Austin has a great mix of geeks, hippies, country folk, and Hispanics.  Sure, there's trash, but it's far and few between.  I play full-contact flag football with people of all sorts – whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians – and everyone gets along great (of course there's scuffles, but it's way less than I had expected).  This just doesn't happen in many cities.

I love Ohio State to death, and would seriously kill to get back to freshman year, but I'll be honest – I’m glad to be here.

After our showing last year, I honestly have no clue how the Horns are going to treat us.  I'd like to think they'll be nice, but everyone down here knows what shitty, trashy hosts we were, so I'm not expecting the best.  We’ll see.

So that’s the dilemma -- I came down here loving the nice people, but at the same time, I'm still a dirty Italian from Cleveland, OH who is far too rough around the edges for these people.  I love the niceness, but man, once in a while this happy sunshine shit needs to be put to a stop.  I hope the Buckeyes can do that.

Now on to the girls.  Man are they hot.  This city is fit, and the girls are FAR hotter than up north.  However, I often miss a good looking girl of Mediterranean descent.  You just don't have any Greeks or Italians down here, and they are what I digg.

It took me a while to figure out the girls down here.  Most of these Texas girls are simply far too boring and conservative for me.  Maybe they'd be great to marry when I'm 30, but I'm 24, and I like my girls loud and outgoing.  All of my favorite females down here are from outside of Texas.  This is why I miss the Annies, Allisons, and Jamies of the world who were in my group during college.

So in Austin, it gets interesting.  You have all these “liberal” “hippies”, who claim to be open about everything.  That is, of course, until religion comes up.

The same goes for the intelligence of the people here.  As much as I love em, I really thought that being in such a tech-based city, they'd be a lot smarter here.  But I was wrong.  Whether they like it or not, they are still in the state with the lowest high school graduation rate.

So the point of my rant  is this:  *As much as many Austinites try to abstract themselves from Texas, they are still Texans*, and with that comes a lot of people who are more conservative than they're willing to realize, and often not the smartest bunch.

But at the same time, those are minor details compared to what I've seen go down in Central Ohio (a certain 270 shooter, a certain murder of one of my favorite guitarists, horribly rude fans...).  I love Austin and my gripes are completely minor.

I quickly mentioned the Texas pride thing – there is a LOT of it, so be prepared.  Texas everything.  Your can of Budweiser will definitely have a Texas shape on it.  There are stars on everything.  In Ohio, you see people driving around with American flags.  In Texas, they have Texas flags.  It was cute at first, and I noticed it immediately, but at this point, it’s old.

A lot of these people have no worldview either (this isn't much different than lots of middle America).  They look at me like I have 3 heads when I mention that I’ve traveled around Europe.  At this point, I’m used to it:  *To these people, life does not exist outside of Texas, and there’s no possibility of anywhere being as superior as Texas.*  Yeah…

And one last thing - don’t expect anyone here to understand sarcastic humor.  Talk about people looking at you like you have 3 heads.  They simply don’t get it, and I have no idea why.  Maybe someone can enlighten me.

So long story short, I love Austin, but man am I looking forward to hanging out with some midwest girls here.  And Jer, Kirby, Dustin, and Andy too!

> LOTS of comments on this one obviously.  Let's start with more from Charles:
*Yes, you OSU fans were pretty ugly to your Texas counterparts on your turf. Actually, insulting. I hope we treat you better, I really do. I look forward to a great game and the unveiling of the next national champion.*
This hurts to hear every time, but it's so true.  What kills me more is the fact that Ohioans argue it, and then shrug it off like it's normal behavior.  I honestly hope we don't get treated like crap, but if we do, I won't be all that surprised.
As far as the intelligence thing goes, I should clarify a bit, as this obviously pissed off plenty of people.  First and foremost, I'll admit that UT is all-around academically better than Ohio Staet.  There, I said it.  The studies show it, and the guys from UT that I work with are just absolute studs.  However, I still feel that the average person in Ohio is of more intelligence than the average Texan... whereas the studs in Texas and UT just destroy the studs at OSU.  Texas just has a way bigger range.
The main reason for that sentiment are all of the simply ridiculous situations I've been in during the last year in Austin that just never happened to me in Ohio.  I'm constantly getting wrong change.  I have to explain to people how to do their own jobs.  "No Ma'am, my dry cleaning should NOT be $3 per shirt".  Hearing educated people viciously argue about who is more liberal... are you kidding me?  Or how about when my friend and I said "we're from Ohio, but we LOVE it here in Austin" and getting yelled at because Texas is so much better than Ohio.And then there's the woman who told me that God talked to her four times on the radio that day.  At some point you just have to wonder, are all of these weird conversations just bad luck, or does Texas just have a crazy range of intelligence?So that's where I stand.  Feel free to disagree, but I've never seen such smart people next to such ridiculousness at the same time.I love Austin (moreso than Columbus/Cleveland/Cincinnati all together), and I really like Texas, but come on Texans... don't expect me to kiss your asses ALL day long on this blog!

**Conclusion**

I doubt anyone's reading this far along, but if you are, thanks.  This is what I've learned, among other stuff, in the past year.  I am happy to pass it on to my Buckeyes.

At this time, I must tell you that by January, I will be in West LA with my own engineering field sales territory.  It is going to hurt to leave this city, but I need to get out of the walls of corporate America, and get out fast.

I look forward to some day returning to Austin and setting up permanent shop.

I hope you have fun, because I sure as hell have!

GO BUCKS!

    Nice review of austin.  As I die-hard longhorn fan forever I respect you opinion of the many places in austin.  Great write ups as well.  Some things I think you haven&#x27;t really taken in as much as you should have (ie the campus), but overall it wasn&#x27;t too negative.  I went to Ohio State last year for the beatdown of the buckeyes and had a blast.  Thanks again.

    good write up but damn man, i&#x27;m mexican and sorry, all the mexican spots you picked are only for white folks and not that great by any means.  do you ever go east of 35?  not completely hating but any authentic mexican will tell you all your spots are over priced or geared for whitey.  not that there is anything specifically wrong with that but i wouldnt necessarily call it the best places to eat mexican food. actually, i definitely would not call them the best places to eat mexican food.  try south congress, cesear chavez, riverside late at night. that is the real deal.  just saying.

    Francisco:

I apologize for being Mexican-insensitive.  You are right.  I am a bit of a lake rat and a gringo, and I don\&#x27;t make it east of I-35 ever.

My favorite authentic Mexican I\&#x27;ve been to is Angie\&#x27;s, but I forgot to add that, and I\&#x27;m not sure if it even counts as authentic.  Does it?

Thanks for posting.

PS:  Oh, and Francisco, one last thing -- you gotta remember that this guide is for OHIOANS.  The typical Ohio State fan doesn\&#x27;t have much culture, and wouldn\&#x27;t appreciate true Mexican food.  The culture in Ohio is mostly Meditterannean(sp) and Germanic.  So I\&#x27;ll kinda stick to my guns and keep the OSU fans at the white-boy Tex-Mex places.

    Hey man, great write up.  I have lived in Austin for over 10 years, attending HS and fixing to graduate from UT and I absolutely love it here.  When I moved here from WV (KY and OK before that) I told myself I&#x27;d never get into the Texan thing but it grows on you and it grows fast.  I honestly think you&#x27;ve done one hell of a job on the write up for the city, there&#x27;s really hardly anything left to add, except there&#x27;s a BBQ place for the downtown located folk called Iron Works on Cesar Chavez (aka 1st St) that for 10.99 you get a MASSIVE beef rib, sausage, and brisket with two sides.  Some of the better BBQ I&#x27;ve found within the close downtown vicinity.  Also, for the visiting people, streets in Austin commonly have two names, 24th is also Windsor, and Manor (depending on which side of the two major throughfares you are on), Mopac is also Loop 1 (which is the road you&#x27;ll be taking on the way to Lake Travis and is the western &quot;highway&quot; through town), etc, etc.  Good luck to yall on the game and for everyone coming down have a safe trip down and home and of course, have a great time in, as has been said by our mayor (yes, here comes some of that Texan pride thing he was talking about) in the greatest city, in the greatest state, in the greatest country in the world.

    Derek - I&#x27;ll respect a 1 touchdown game, but I think you got those scores flipped...

Anyway, the problem I see with UT&#x27;s campus is that it&#x27;s just too close to downtown and there isn&#x27;t enough room to spread out and get more green.  Most college campuses have way more green than does UT&#x27;s.

The cool thing about UT&#x27;s sights are the wimmin :)

Plus, I had to throw in some obligatory trash talk!

John - Thanks for the invite.. I plan on making my way over to the area sometime.  I&#x27;ve never been to hornsfans.com, but the CGI message boards seemed to be down.  I&#x27;m too busy to go talk friendly smack on other boards usually anyway.

    Not to step on Fransico&#x27;s Mexican Food bona fides, but I believe the outline heading was Tex-Mex, which is altogether different than Mexican Food.  There are some great places on the east side to eat to be sure, but thinking Mexican food &quot;geared for whitey&quot; doesn&#x27;t qualify for Tex-Mex seems a little elitist.

    Hey man, I&#x27;m a UT student and I think you did a great writeup. As far as Mexican food you were a little off, (Angies and Maudies get my vote) but I agree that the Mexican martini at Trudies will mess you up.

    Awesome, all-encompassing detail of our fine city. I must take exception to your generalization about Austin&#x27;s intelligence level. I am not sure where you are coming from with that one. This town is liberal minded, fit, technologically advanced and pretty ethnically diverse (although segregated like nearly all American cities). Not exactly a bunch of country bumpkins here. 

Outside of that statement, you did a great job and even described some places that I, as a UT senior, have yet to experience but should. 

Don&#x27;t worry about being treated poorly in TEXAS. We are the legendary cordial southerners. Maybe you yankee trash can learn a thing or two about hospitality ; ) *

This doesn&#x27;t mean that Robert Killebrew and Mike Griffin will pass up an opportunity to skullfuck Troy and your season.

God bless Texas.

    I too am a big fan of Maudies (the one on Lake Austin Blvd) and Angies for mexican food..the others don&#x27;t hold a candle.

Artz Rib House on south Lamar is the best for pork spare ribs (Friday special) and they have really great musicians too...some folk, some country, depends on the night.

As to Buckeyes fans coming to Austin, we welcome you.  Be prepared for the heat in early Sept.  It was 105 degrees yesterday and expect 106 today.  Lots of places to go, all types of music as Mike said.  Come for a day or two extra and go out to the lake...you won&#x27;t regret it!

    I was at the OSU-UT game in Columbus.  There were over 400,000 people there and half were drunk.  There was definitely some nastiness that was not needed but I dont think it was southcentral LA at night or anything.  I talked to at least 300 Texas fans that were having a ball and bought them beers when I could.

At the very last minute I ended up with an extra ticket.  There was a UT college student who was crying because she had left her ticket on her dresser (so she says) in her dorm room.  She and her friends only had $60.00 and tickets were going for at least $200 before kickoff.  I sold her the ticket for $60.00 ( I had $100 in the ticket).  I took some heat for it, good natured of course, but I didnt want her to miss out on a once in a lifetime type night.  I dont care what anyone says, the most exciting game in 2005 was in columbus on september 10th.  

I just wanted to share the story so our brothers from Texas didn&#x27;t think that all of us Guys in Ohio were jerks.

    I&#x27;ve been in Austin for 10 yrs, and commend you on a good write up!  (Especially for someone that&#x27;s only been here +/- 1 year.  However, let&#x27;s not generalize Section 9 - the People.  Sure, there are plenty of &#x27;country&#x27; types that haven&#x27;t travelled, but I think you&#x27;ll agree if you really get a good sampling, that we&#x27;re well travelled, like edumacated, and 95% overly friendly.  ;)

I was in Columbus for last year&#x27;s game, and can tell you that my tailgating crew has decided to attempt to kill your fans too. But, we&#x27;ll kill you with kindness at our tailgate. We&#x27;re doubling up our beer, and bbq output, and will offer it out to buckeyes that visit.  Them Columbus&#x27;ites (is that right?) need to learn that aggression isn&#x27;t the way to go about life! Yikes.

For bfast, I highly recommend Las Manitas Avenue Cafe on 3rd and congress, and El Sol y La Luna, and Guero&#x27;s on south congress about a mile from townlake for mexican lunch or decenlty priced dinner.

    As a 5th generation Austinite, i have to say great write up... as far as BBQ downtown everyone needs to do themselves a service and go to Iron Works, your mind will be blown away.

Here is my South Congress write up:

tons of Austin owned shops, plenty of restaunts, boutiques, and dives. Here are my favorites.

Home Slice Pizza: the best pie in Austin... and I think you would agree.

Doc&#x27;s Motorworks: great little bar with an awesome vibe... i only go on Thursdays so their prices maybe a little high.

Threadgill&#x27;s: awesome downhome food with an &quot;Austin-tacious&quot; band usually on the bill. Old home of Armadillo World Headquarters... the place where Willie started his hippie vibe and many came to follow.

    Loved the write up.  I am a UT grad now working in ATX and you really nailed almost everything.  Hope plenty of your fellow Bucks read this review.  I completely agreed with your mention of slow drivers.  I don&#x27;t think it is in the other big cities of Houston and Dallas, but for some reason, my fellow Austinites like to mentally space out or just stare at the nice scenery as they drive and go a good 10mph under.  And the bumper stickers are the most hideous things ever.  They are always some corny politcal, animal or environmental reference like &quot;My kitty cat votes for Kerry &#x27;04&quot; or &quot;Trees are the sunshine in my life!&quot;

    It&#x27;s just a shame you weren&#x27;t in Austin 14 yrs ago when GM steakhouse ruled the drag and had some great cheese burgers--extra pickles.  Maddogs and beans was closed ( a close second on burgers) and Dirty&#x27;s is still there

It should be a refreshing change of pace for those from the mid-west trying to get away from bland food.  Make sure and try some good Mexican beer like a modelo or bohemia.  Try a shiner.  Ask for a marg with good tequilla--no Cuervo isn&#x27;t on that list.  Try food you can&#x27;t get at home-- please don&#x27;t eat enchilladas because you will never want to eat at El Chico again when you get home.  

And please don&#x27;t talk trash, because you have to go home afterwards and we get to stay in Austin getting a tan and swimming in my pool up until Nov 1.

    I found this to be an incredibly good write-up for someone in town not very long.   I can appreciate the good and the bad of the city and it&#x27;s nice to hear an  outsiders perspective.   

The one disagreement I have is with the intelligence of the people.  I think you might have speant to much time around a particular demographic.  Think about the spots you spent the most time on,  Devils cove and 6th street.   

There is a whole other world of people in this town of extremely high intelligence.    In a city that&#x27;s doubled in size the last 15 years you obviously have a bunch of transplants.   So any generalization about &quot;Austinites&quot; is really not accurate.    I&#x27;ve been here 17 years and can count on my fingers the number of people I know who were born and raised here.  

If you do end up coming back to Austin later in your career you will find your peer group to be extremely intelligent.   Most likely because you won&#x27;t be  talking to diddle heads on 6th street and lake whores at Devils Cove.  

If you do end up moving out of Austin with plans to return, the smartest thing you could do is put down a downpayment on a yet to be built downtown condo.   You won&#x27;t have to pay a management company to rent it for you  and it will be a couple hundred grand cheaper than when you return.

    I don&#x27;t live in Austin, but I do visit there when I can.  I am a lifetime fan of The University of Texas.  Although I did not attend Texas, I have some of my relatives that did graduate from UT.

I enjoyed reading your take on Austin and Texas.  It&#x27;s a shame that you think Texans are dumber than the rest of the country, but if that&#x27;s the type of people you&#x27;ve encountered, then I guess you&#x27;re entitled to your opinion.

It&#x27;s amazing to me the difference between the people of Texas and the people of Ohio (at least the OSU fans).  The way the OSU fans acted at last year&#x27;s game in Columbus was pitiful.  

For the most part, when the OSU fans come down to Austin, they will find the majority of Texans hospitable and very friendly.

After reading the responses to your post, I was happy to see that most Texans were not offended or angry with the negative remarks made about the city of Austin, our state, citizens, stadium, and campus.  (I wonder what the repsonses would have been if a Texas fan had written the same about Columbus or Ohio folks).  

The positive remarks did outweigh the negative and it was a very thorough guide for not only out-of-staters, but for anyone visiting Austin.  I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve enjoyed your stay in Austin and I hope when you return to Austin (and the great state of Texas) one day, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  You can then buy season tickets to the Texas games and become a fan of the best college in America. 

I wish the OSU fans a safe trip and a good time while they&#x27;re in the great state of Texas.  

My prediction for the game is:

Texas 24
OSU    14

    Kudos, young man (I am roughly twice your age) for coming down to Texas with a reasonably open mind and willingness to get out and sample what Austin has to offer, which, as you note, is quite a lot.

I did something similar right out of college--spent about a year and a half living and working in the Dakotas and Colorado.  It was a tremendously broadening experience for me putting many of the fundamental, unconscious assumptions I grew up with in better perspective.

The main specific comment I would make is to caution you against interpreting a loud, outspoken, in-your-face manner as a sign of intelligence (or the opposite--that nice, quiet folk are necessarily not so bright).  Still waters sometimes do run deep.  If you come on too strong, particularly in a northeastern, ethnic manner, folk down here may be a bit put off and keep their ideas (which may have some merit) to themselves.

Stated another way, I found that one of the key elements to really learning about another cultural milieu was to be a good listener.

In the context of my general admiration for your hutzpah, this is a relative trifle.  Well done.  Enjoy the rest of your time in Austin and best of luck in future endeavors.

    What a great write up!!  I am really looking forward to this trip and tailgaiting with some Texas fans.  As for last years game in Columbus, I must say I find it distrurbing that Texas fans were treated or felt they were treated poorly.  I spent the 6 hours before the game in the Lane Avenue - Hineygate area and talked with many Texas fans.  I found them to be freindly, engaging, knowledgeable people - just the kind of fans that make a college game day a great experience.  I personally didn&#x27;t witness any bantering, swearing, fighting, etc. either before or after the game.  

That being said, put 100,000+ people together many of whom drink most of the day before the game and you will have some trouble.  Regardless of who the opponents are or where the game is being played, recreate this scenario and there will be trouble.  I expect it in Austin although I know at least 99% of the Texas fans I meet will just like the great people I met in Columbus last year.

As for Ohio State&#x27;s number 1 ranking, I don&#x27;t buy it.  Texas is the defending national champion and should be ranked number 1 until they are beaten.  I just hope the Buckeyes are the team that does it.

Thanks again for the great article.

    I know some of you Buckeyes will be travelling down here with some serious dough to drop. 

If you want the best Mexican food this side of Mexico City, get your butts down to Fonda San Miguel - a true interior Mexican food restaurant. It is nothing like the Tex-Mex that everyone refers to as Mexican here. It is truly fantastic. The Sunday brunch is a must before you get back on your planes to go home. 

http://www.fondasanmiguel.com/

If you lke French cuisine, check out Aquarelle. Consistently one of the three best restaurants in the city, and I would put it up there with any restaurant in the state. 

http://www.aquarellerestaurant.com/

I cannot recommend these two restaurants enough. Truly a culinary experience. If any of you try either one of these restaurants, prepare to have your socks knocked off and drop a lot of coin. You will NOT regret it.

Welcome to Texas. Have safe trips all and I will see you in DKR Memorial Stadium on the 9th.

    Great writeup from the perspective of this Ohio-born Texan of thirty one years.  Few quibbles:  

Manuels for Mexican AND for mambo at night.  You don&#x27;t have to dance to appreciate a hot mambo band (and the women who ARE dancing).  Wanna really impress a girl?  Go to Fonda San Miguel (and make reservations at least four days in advance).  Best interior Mexican in the entire US, according to those who know. 

Beer #1:  don&#x27;t forget the Draught House.  Not a meat market, it&#x27;s a place to drink BEER.  

Beer #2:  lots of good beer made in central Texas, whether you&#x27;re buying by the pint or by the case.  Ask and ye shall receive.  

Beer #3:  At tailgate, I gar-awn-teee Texas fans will feed you and beer you, just so long as you&#x27;re a good guest.  

Best burger = Casino El Camino on 6th.  Take cash, go early, be prepared to wait.  

Game:  low scoring affair, whatever the outcome.  Fewer than 35 points altogether.  

Overall:  if you&#x27;re hitting on the girls at Woodrow&#x27;s, it&#x27;s no wonder you think Austin girls are conservative and dim.  Just hit a little closer to campus and avoid girls with roots who think that &quot;um&quot; is a word.  Woodrow&#x27;s is a little piece of Dallas, right there, and I&#x27;d just as soon build a 30&#x27; wall around it.  

Also, Austinites nowadays have shallow roots, most have been here just a few years at best.  Meeting people in downtown Austin is like meeting people in San Francisco or London in that most people are from somewhere else, often far away, making &quot;Austinite&quot; more or less meaningless.

    Nice write up, really.  Besides differing opinions about what to do, where to go and where to eat (we all have opinions), the only thing I would argue with is the education point.  I&#x27;m not sure what crowd you run with, but Austin is usually considered over-educated.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for folks with BA, BS or even graduate degrees to be working as bartenders, etc. solely because they want to stay in Austin.  UT has a large number of graduate students is is more focused on graduate studies and research anyway.  Austin isn&#x27;t a northern town, so the immigrant communities you are used to aren&#x27;t its roots, but that doesn&#x27;t make the citizens dumb.  As for high school graduation rates, Texas is far from the worst, more like middle of the road, but in any event, lack of education isn&#x27;t Austin&#x27;s problem, just ask the folks who list Austin as one of the top relocation destinations for corporations who cite educated work force as one of the critical components.

    Even after hearing the horror stories about the treatment of Texas fans in Columbus, it hadn&#x27;t even occurred to me to be a jerk in return.

Hit the tailgate parties around Scholz&#x27;s, be ready to give and receive some good-natured smack-talk (and VERY educated football talk), and you&#x27;ll have a good time, drink plenty of free beer, and eat some of the best grub on earth (I would guess that a few hundred briskets will be served in that 3-4 block area that day -- mine is the best, though).

And for a taste of Texas, and old-school Texas at that, especially for fans who are just a bit past the trendy-bar age, a trip to the Broken Spoke would be just the ticket.  Wear jeans, explain to folks that you are from Ohio and have no idea how to 2-step but would like to learn (if you are smart, you&#x27;ll have that conversation with a lovely young lady), and you will spend the rest of your evening with some brand-new friends.

Breakfast at Las Manitas, if you are staying anywhere near downtown, is an ABSOLUTE MUST.

Maybe hit the Texas Chili Parlour for a bowl of XXX -- if you can take it.

Go just east of the stadium area (just on the other side of I-35) to Hoover&#x27;s, on Manor Road, for some real Texas/southern home cooking.  The glorious Texas dish that is chicken fried steak should not be missed by any yankee visitor.

And if y&#x27;all want to bring some real italian food with you, we&#x27;d be glad to trade some barbecue for it!

We&#x27;re looking forward to a damned fun day.  And seeing Brian Robison hit Troy Smith so hard it kills his whole family, but that&#x27;s for the boys on the field to do.

    Casino El Camino is the place for burgers. Sullivan&#x27;s by 4th and Colorado is a steak place that will make you a steak burger for less than 10 bucks that&#x27;s mindblowing.

There are plenty of smart people in Austin -- but you won&#x27;t find them on 6th street. We know better than to hang out there. Sucks for people living downtown, but for people visiting from out-of-town, you should get by fine. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re not looking for the scintillating conversation.

Welcome, Buckeyes! (Please don&#x27;t burn our couches. Thanks.)

    I actually think you did a good job with this, but you are like other northerners who play into that stereotype of Texans as simple, uneducated people.  Anyone can see the historical reasons for that view, but it doesn&#x27;t really apply in this day and age, especially in Austin.  I would wonder whether this observation came from actually talking to people, or rather the general bias from northern or eastern city populations for that matter.

As a Texan who&#x27;s lived on the east and west coasts, traveled Europe, etc. I used to this common perception.  I think it more says something about the people who maintain this argument.

    Great write up.  I think you really came down with an open mind and tried to soak up what us Austinites love about the city.  A few more things I highly recommend:

1) Lake Austin - not quite as large as Lake Travis, but still has gorgeous scenery and isn&#x27;t as far of a drive as Travis.  Because the water is less choppy, it&#x27;s a lot better for water skiing and wakeboarding.  The houses around the lake are Austin&#x27;s most impressive and many belong to celebrities like Sandra Bullock, Matthew McConnaghy, Lance Armstrong, Andy Roddick, etc.  Quick note though:  the water is alot colder because it comes from the bottom of Lake Travis (Mansfield Dam).

2) Hula Hut - you have to go there for the atmosphere.  Polynesian - Tex-Mex fusion restaurant that sits on a pier on Lake Austin.  Even better if you can arrive by boat.  It&#x27;s really popular though, so the wait times can be a little ridiculous. Located on the west end of Lake Austin Blvd.

3) Mt. Bonnell - a hill (TX mountain :-) and park just west of downtown that overlooks the Texas Hill County and Lake Austin.  It&#x27;s a short hike up 106 steps, but the view at sunset with the Pennebacker (360) bridge in the background is amazing.  My buddy proposed here a few months ago.  Just take 38th St. west til you run into it.  

4) Tubing - nothing beats a hot summer day like floating down the Guadalupe with a bunch of friends.  Fill up your cooler and rent an extra tube for it and you&#x27;re set.  Go south of I-35 to New Braunfels.

5) P.Terry&#x27;s - if you&#x27;ve ever tried In &amp;amp; Out Burgers in Cali, this is Austin&#x27;s version.  Burgers are excellent, but small, so definitely get the bigger burgers or get multiples.  It&#x27;s on Lamar and Barton Springs Rd.

I can&#x27;t wait to make my return to Texas, Austin, Devil&#x27;s Cove, Carlos and Charlie&#x27;s, 6th St.(Need to run into some TCU ladies), Rudy&#x27;s(I miss Texas BBQ), and the tailgate scene.  Hey, maybe we will stumble upon a fiesta on the bridge again!

    I enjoyed your piece on Austin.  I was born there (many years ago) and had many relatives in the area.  Went to The University, of course, for my B.A. and then to Ohio State for my M.A.  There are a couple of things I disagree with, though.  I don&#x27;t understand your comments about the Tower and the campuses of the two schools.  Although you&#x27;re in good company not being excited about the Tower (J. Frank Dobie hated it; called for laying it on its side and planting vines along it, and characterized the top as a &quot;Greek outhouse&quot;), I still think it has a sort of charm and is an iconic building.  The very earliest sound I recall is the sound of the chimes and I was probably 3 or 4 when my parents took me out in the yard one night to point out the top lit up orange.  Back before Austin got a skyline, you used to be able to see it from miles away and it was always great driving back to Austin after a win.  Texas&#x27; campus is more compact than Ohio State&#x27;s, but it also has more architectural integrity (Ohio State has none, as far as I can tell).  I&#x27;ll admit, the Oval and Mirror Lake are pretty in an English country village kind of way, but there&#x27;s a lot to be said for the uniform nature of the buildings on Texas&#x27; inner campus (the old &quot;40 Acres&quot;).  What Texas doesn&#x27;t have is lots of grass and big trees, but that&#x27;s a function of the climate.

The other thing I disagree with you about - the score.

    Matt&#x27;s El Rauncho is to Mexican food what a raven is to a writing desk: a bad joke.  It&#x27;s nasty.  It&#x27;s terrifying.  Better to stay home and throw an El Patio tv dinner in the oven.  Poo.  Ick. Yuk.

Ruby&#x27;s BBQ on Guadalupe. Not the fastest place in the world, but excellent BBQ.

I&#x27;ll agree with the others.  If you&#x27;re not finding biting humor and witty sarcasm, you&#x27;re hanging out in the wrong places.

    It would be a shame to miss breakfast at Cisco&#x27;s Grill on the other side of 6th street. Migas and fajitas are recommended. Yes, you OSU fans were pretty ugly to your Texas counterparts on your turf. Actually, insulting. I hope we treat you better, I really do. I look forward to a great game and the unveiling of the next national champion.

    Nice article. I really enjoyed your view of Texas. I am looking forward to the game. I have found Texans to be very polite and cheerful. As an Ohioan reading all the comments about last years game and how people were treated from Texas, I want to apologize. I also want you to know that is not how it is here in Ohio. I am from a small town in Ohio, hometown of Quinn Pitcock #90 and future Buckeye Brandon Saine. I think that these two men represent Ohio very well. I only hope others follow their lead. My prediction is Texas 17 - OSU 28. Good luck to all in Texas. Wish I could afford to got to the game and root on the Bucks.

    Overall, a thourough review.  I do have a proble with your grad rate comment about Texas not being smart.  Texas has a really high rate of people immigrating into Texas.  English id their 2nd language.  Do you think that might be why the grad rate is so low?  Why as of today, Cleveland is rated as the poorest city in the US?  Is it stupid people that can&#x27;t figure out how to make money?  Correlation does not me causation.

    Hey Mike,

A very good and informative post.  Actually I&#x27;m not Texan by birth but have lived here for 10+ years, in Houston, College Station, and now Dallas area.  But I have also lived up north.  I would have to agree with your take on Texan girls being way too conservative.  And you&#x27;re talking about Austin girls calling themselves liberal and open to everything...imagine how it is when the topic of religion or ethnicity comes up in, say, College Station, where the crowd is definitely way more conservative, and openly at that.  haha  I just find it funny that the &quot;liberal&quot; Texans don&#x27;t know how conservative they really are!

By the way, if I extrapolate your choice of girls in Austin, you definitely won&#x27;t like the Dallas girls... they&#x27;re pretty much known to be fake and looking out more for how much you make than anything else...you&#x27;ll find scores of &quot;hot&quot; girls with older rich guys at various game venues.

As always great job in the write up and such a useful / helpful tool. Some of my friends from school have live down there for past 30 years verify that your comments that the Ohioan’s will probably / hopefully get allot better reception than we Provided.  
Good Luck

    Well written review.  However, I have to agree with those that have issue with your intellegence remark.  Just a few weeks ago, Austin was listed in the top five cities in the country in terms of citizens with college degrees (per capita).
We are also considered the second most wirelessly connected internet city (next to SF CA).  Of course, not all have degrees and some that do are still stupid, but statistically speaking, your observation is skewed for one reason or another.

I also have to defend the OSU fans that I encountered.  I had several nice conversations in Columbus last year and for the most part, I was not hassled at all.  There were a few that gave us a little grief before the game, but I actually thought that was pretty hilarious.  Of course, I kept my cheering to a polite minimum during the game and I&#x27;m a pretty big dude so not many people would get in my face anyway, but I was surprised to hear the comments when I got back.  I plan to be gracious before the game as well in victory after.  

Hook&#x27;em

    Good write up about Austin. I have no qualms with Ohio. It&#x27;s pretty but way too cold. I think the idea that Texans are dim-witts is so wrong, especially considering that Austinites hold more degrees than most Americans. Texas is a bilingual state which used to be frowned upon, yet now is an economic asset.  Just like people in Ohio have stereotypes about Texans, many in the West see Ohio as still stuck in the &quot;rust belt&quot; with a depressed economy and lack of intellectual careers. Stereotypes go both ways.
