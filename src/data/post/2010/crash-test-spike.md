Last fall, I filmed a reality TV pilot for **Spike TV** called **Crash Test**.  On **Tuesday, April 27th**, Spike TV is going to air the pilot at **11PM EST** (check your local listings - DirecTV and other satellite networks will be off of the east coast feed!).

In Crash Test, Hollywood stunt expert Jack Gill leads an elite team of stuntmen, scientists, and investigators as they recreate full scale accidents to prove who is guilty or innocent.

Here are two YouTube videos to check out:

Stunt Teaser videos

If Spike TV sees enough viewership and DVR recordings, it will may get greenlit for a full season.

So please pass this e-mail on, post the videos and DVR times to your Facebook and Twitter feeds, and spread the good word!

I am the biomedical engineering expert on the show, wearing red.  It is my job to measure and determine whether or not these accidents would have created the injuries that the defendants claimed... had we not been using stunt pros.

I was brought into the show at the last minute after filming had begun.  I had no clue what was going on (which often shows), but it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life.  The guys on the show all rule.

The show stars four of us, not including the stuntmen:
Jack Gill - Stunt Expert / Leader
Casey Noel - Stunt Rigger / Safety
TJ Josefy - Investigator / Crime-Scene Recreator
Mike Roberto - Biomedical Engineer

The show is also known as Crash Test: Real Wrecks, Real Stakes.
Cheers!

    Great show.

Who is the narrator? His voice sounds terribly familiar.

    This show was excellent! It was perfectly set up for suspense and has a realistic feel since the results of the re-enactments are used to determine real situations. The results were very extrordinary in nature and prove things that seem impossible to perception, in fact, possible. This is a must watch show and I hope that it gains enough interest in order to keep rolling for years to come. Watch out Myth Busters, this stuff is much more relavent than determining if JAWS could be blown up with a gun. I talked my wife in to sitting down with me to watch it (my second time) and she was glued to the TV and I found her tensing up at times.

The show had three different senarios (cases) to prove. Thet were each different in nature but I could have watched each of them for an entire show. I thought for sure that the water slide would never reach the speed needed to recreate the senario. And I never thought that a Chevy Tahoe could fly 100ft. in the air at 50mph. Incredible footage in HD and high-speed photography.

Two thumbs and two big toes up from me on this one and I am craving more.

PEACE

    I think the narrator is John Gegenhuber, at least to me it sounds like him.
