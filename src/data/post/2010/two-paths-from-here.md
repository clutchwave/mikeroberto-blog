> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	
I took the one less traveled by,	
And that has made all the difference.
*--Robert Frost*

Tomorrow is the big day.  My first day as a fully self-employed entrepreneur.

Over the past few months, as I've seen this time coming, I asked myself who I was going to be in the foreseeable future.  And the more I thought and talked about it, the more clear it became.

I could really see it going one of two ways.

The first way is the easy way.  As it stands now, I could very easily live off of the profits from my websites without dipping into my savings.  I'd have to watch the expenses, but could easily do 15 minutes of work per day and become a total beach bum.  I'd play volleyball, become a better surfer, work out all day, drink cheap malt liquor, and do whatever the hell it is that all of these California bums you see wandering around all day do.  Occasionally, I'd get inspired and launch a new web campaign and make it profitable.

The second path is the exact opposite.  Go for The Empire.  Dominate several tiny niches of the web, then aggregate them into a massive network that feeds into an enormous machine.  Attack industries that need attacking, and inform users that need informing.  Hire employees, learn social media, and even do "In Real Life" marketing.  Buy a fancy house, own a boat, and invest in land - all in cash.  Stay healthy, keep racing, and learn some new weapon skills, but occasionally go on some ridiculous international trip and let things coast for the week.

I really could see me doing either for a while.  But it's pretty much one or the other.

And as things become more and more clear, I am pretty sure I know which one it's going to be.  You probably do too.

    The same drive that got you to this point is the same personality trait that will prevent you from &#x27;settling&#x27; with choice #1.

    BertoSon - Once again, you amaze me with your linguistic talents. Of course, I will support you in whichever path you choose. However, when I come to visit (which will be often), I will be much more comfortable in a big house than in a tent on the beach.... Congrats again - now let&#x27;s get this party started.
