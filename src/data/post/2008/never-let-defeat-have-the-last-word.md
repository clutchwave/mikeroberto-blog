    Wow. Just an awe-inspiring swim. Definitely the most clutch Olympic swim I&#x27;ve ever seen, just barely edging out Alexandre &quot;The Russian Rocket&quot; Popov winning the 50 and the 100 in Atlanta after getting stabbed by a fruit vender in Russia, and 5&#x27;8&#x27;&#x27; Mike Barrowman destroying the field in the 200 breast in Barcelona.

Hope you&#x27;re beaglin&#x27; in Cali.
