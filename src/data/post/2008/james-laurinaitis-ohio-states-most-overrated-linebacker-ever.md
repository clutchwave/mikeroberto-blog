This will come as complete blasphemy to the Buckeye faithful, but it is true:  James Laurinaitis is the most overrated linebacker Ohio State has ever had.

I'm not saying this because I hate the guy, or because I think I'm better than him -- I am not.  I am saying this because the fingers have been pointed all over the place for our terrible loss to LSU, except for one of the most important spots:  the heart of the defense.  And if we are going to prevent humiliation in 2008, the problems need to be addressed.

For those of you still with me, I urge you to stop being spiral-eyed, brainwashed zombies for 15 minutes so that you can objectively look at the game film with me.

All season long, we have endured Laurinaitis' endless hesitation, jumping on top of piles after the plays are already over, and shooting of the wrong gap, which are occasionally joined by an impact play.  But everyone slobbered over his 'tackle count' and occasional interception.  LSU and Illinois both knew this, and exposed us right where it counted:  straight up the middle.

Enough talk, let's get to the OSU vs. LSU game film (this is not easy to do, but we must do it):

**First Quarter**

- Defensive Play 1, 1st and 10, 13:34
Freeman already makes the play, JL jumps on the pile.  Good play #1.  A sign of things to come?  For Freeman, no.  For Laurinaitis, yes.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-01-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-01.jpg)
So I'm guessing this was one of #33's **18** tackles?

- Defensive Play 2, 2nd and 7, 13:05
Pass play in the flats dropped by LSU

- Freeze to video of Tedd Ginn Jr. wearing Chicago White Sox gear, some ridiculous t-shirt, and beads. Lame.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-02-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-02.jpg)

- Defensive Play 3, 3rd and 7, 12:53
Botched snap, JL second man on the scene.  All Buckeyes are laughing at this point.

- Defensive Play 4, 1st and 10, 9:12
Grant makes the first of his many good plays.  JL in pursuit, gets a bit stuck in traffic, then jumps on the pile.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-03-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-03.jpg)

- Defensive Play 5, 2nd and 9, 8:35
You can't see him here, but I assure you that #33 is behind  #79 and 71 (Carnell Stewart, who he'll be seeing plenty of).  A double-team that nobody in college football is going to beat.  Another Larry Grant play.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-04-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-04.jpg)

- Defensive Play 6, 3rd and 7, 7:50
Pass away from JL, blown coverage by Freeman, first down LSU.

- Defensive Play 7, 1st and 10, 7:25
LSU dumps off to the right to #45 Johnson, Larry Grant on the coverage/tackle.  JL was the third guy there.  So far not looking that bad...

- Defensive Play 8, 2nd and 7, 7:15
Hester run, pretty tough stop made by Laurinaitis.  Get your hat in front of him and you might be able to stop that extra yardage, but that's no easy feat on Hester.  A good play, could have been great.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-05-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-05.jpg)

- Defensive Play 8, 3rd and 3, 6:45
JL absolutely manhandled by 71.  But it looks like he might be able to shake free and make the play!
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-06a-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-06a.jpg)
Guess not.  Denlinger blew it on this one too.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-06b-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-06b.jpg)

- Defensive Play 9, 1st and 10, 6:11
Russell absolutely burned.  Laurinaitis can only watch from the middle.

- Defensive Play 10, 1st and 10, 5:59
Run left, Laurinaitis makes the angle-grabbing tackle on Doucet.  Not a bad play, but Katzenmoyer and company would have put him 6 feet under.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-07-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-07.jpg)

- Defensive Play 11, 2nd and 6, 5:25
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-08a-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-08a.jpg)
Play already made by Freeman, JL has a chance to finish him off and drive him backwards, but instead sets him down nice and easy.  What a gentleman!
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-08b-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-08b.jpg)

- Defensive Play 12, 3rd and 1, 4:41
JL in position to make a huge play, look where he's got his helmet on Hester!  Unfortunately, he is overpowered due to the futility of his sideways-tackle (he is literally perpendicular to the ballcarrier).  Yeah, those usually don't work on a guy like Hester.  First down Tigers.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-09-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-09.jpg)

- Defensive Play 13, 1st and 10, 4:09
Flynn runs, Grant with another solid play.  Hey, look who's jumping on the pile!  Go get em Animal, just like in the WWF!
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-10-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-10.jpg)

- Defensive Play 14, 2nd and 10, 3:20
JL blitzes outside, goes nowhere.  Blown play on Flynn, entire defensive front in there.

- Defensive Play 15, 3rd and 13, 2:31
Pressure Gholston and Heyward, Flynn throws it away.  **Field goal LSU, 10-3 Buckeyes.**

- Defensive Play 16, 1st and 10, 0:07
Whoops!  Can you guess who catches this one?  Probably the guy that's wide open in the middle of our baby-soft zone.  End of first quarter
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-11-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-11.jpg)

**Second Quarter**

- Defensive Play 17, 2nd and 4, 15:00
Now this is a good one!  JL and Freeman both make their blockers miss, who then in turn block each other!  Tackle made by #1 mostly, but #33 is definitely there.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-12-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-12.jpg)

- Defensive Play 18, 3rd and 1, 14:23
Heacock blitzes Laurinaitis, which opens a big hole.  Stupid play call!  Hester vs. Anderson Russell = bloodbath.  First down LSU.

- Defensive Play 19, 1st and 10, 14:05
Option left, how did Grant not get Perrilloux?  Laurinaitis blocked at both levels and looked slow on this one.  Bullshit Late hit, but the first of many stupid OSU penalties.

- Defensive Play 20, 1st and 10, 13:55
Dump left, Laurinaitis drops back, gets blocked, and dives 7(!) yards from the tackle in an obvious attempt to jump on the pile.  Great play Heyward.  I'm starting to wonder where these 18 tackles came from, so I'm guessing they gave #33 one here too.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-13-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-13.jpg)

- Defensive Play 21, 2nd and 11, 13:16
If you listen close enough, you can hear Laurinaitis and Freeman yell "Oh, shit!" simultaneously here.  Freeman blows a big one.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-14-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-14.jpg)
But wait, there's more!  Facemask on #33!  Great job guys!  And we're excited to have both of them back for 2008?

- Defensive Play 22, 1st and 10, 13:05
Yep.  All-American.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-15-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-15.jpg)
If you can't tell by this picture, let me put it to you this way:  There's nobody in between the tight end and the endzone.

- (Missed Robiskie TD pass [hey, he's from Cleveland, what'd you expect?], blocked field goal [what happened to Tressel's special teams over the past few years?])
<li>Defensive Play 23, 1st and 10, 10:42
Option right.
Announcer:  "Gholston doesn't take the bait but will have no help behind him"
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-16-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-16.jpg)
By "no help", he means #33 and everyone else are getting punished by #71 again.

- Defensive Play 24, 2nd and 1, 10:29
Pass incomplete down the sideline, Larry Grant puts a hit on Flynn.  Man is he a beast.

- Defensive Play 25, 3rd and 1, 10:23
Hester is in... so let's blitz Freeman on the strong side and send JL over to the left, leaving the middle wide open.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-17-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-17.jpg)
HEACOCK STOP BLITZING YOU FOOL!

- Defensive Play 26, 1st and 10, 10:03
I'm running out of synonyms for "manhandled".  Stewart (71) is having his way with JL.  Grant on the stop.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-18-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-18.jpg)

- Defensive Play 27, 2nd and 10, 9:20
Dear God.  Heacock blitzes JL to the left, who realizes his coach's folly and makes his way back to the runner all in time to whiff on the the tackle!
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-19-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-19.jpg)
Gain of 9 on this one.  Looks unlikely from the picture, doesn't it?

- Defensive Play 28, 3rd and 1, 8:45
Flynn keeps it, defensive line gets owned, it doesn't matter who your LB is here.
#33 somehow becomes the last person on the pile, but the last person to get up, swimming his way towards Flynn and further padding his stats.

- Defensive Play 29, 1st and 10, 8:24
Pass batted down by Grant.  JL in coverage.

- Defensive Play 30, 2nd and 10, 8:13
Flynn on another keeper, and look at this -- JL has a chance to put him on his back right here!
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-20-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-20.jpg)
But what happens?  Another terrible form tackle around the ankles, giving Flynn 3 more yards.  This is Flynn, not Hester.

- Defensive Play 31, 3rd and 5, 7:40
Laurainitis blitz, gets to Flynn but a second too late.  Touchdown LSU.  This is getting painful.  LSU 17, OSU 10.

- Defensive Play 31, 1st and 10, 6:15 (Boeckman interception)
Another worthless MLB/WLB combo blitz.  Barrow drops into coverage, can't keep up, 8 yard pass.  Way to go Heacock.  Please resign.

- Defensive Play 32, 2nd and 2, 5:45
Grant and Laurinaitis blitz AGAIN.  Nobody is in the middle (I mean nobody!) Heacock, you are now officially retarded.  You think this blitzing isn't working?

- Defensive Play 33, 1st and goal, 5:29
WOW.  Now THAT'S how OSU linebackers play.  Hester gets pasted by JL here.  Wow!
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-21-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-21.jpg)

- Defensive Play 34, 2nd and goal, 4:56
Hester stuffed again by Larimore and Laurainitis.  Finally some good plays!

- Defensive Play 35, 3rd and goal, 4:30
#33 hesitates way too long and makes the stop one step too short.  I don't understand how you can go from play 33 to this garbage on the goal line.  He simply dances while Hester gains the momentum of a freight train.  Touchdown LSU.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-22-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-22.jpg)
Two good plays and one awful play = you lose.  I know the punt is an important play, Jim, but what about 3rd downs?

**Third quarter**

- Defensive Play 36, 1st and 10, 15:00
1.  JL gets blown up
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-23a-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-23a.jpg)

2.  JL gets off the block, but overpursues
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-23b-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-23b.jpg)

3.  JL jumps on the ballcarrier after Freeman has already tackled him.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-23c-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-23c.jpg)
That sounds about typical.

- Defensive Play 37, 1st and 10, 14:40
At this point, LSU has figured things out and are simply attacking Laurinaitis.  A wonderful one-handled catch, which #33 should have been able to knock away if he was within 2 steps of the receiver.  Good coverage is not good enough.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-24-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-24.jpg)

- Defensive Play 38, 2nd and 5, 13:59
Option.  JL covers his assignment (the pitch), but Perrilloux keeps.  Unfortunately, #33 also dances for 2 seconds while Perrilloux has already crossed the line of scrimmage.  This guy has no killer instinct.

- Defensive Play 39, 3rd and 1, 13:23
James and Heacock are both having a terrible game.  A Hester run up the middle and he is nowhere to be found.  Not sure who made this gap assignment, but I like my middle linebackers to stay in the middle on 3rd and 1 and an obvious Hester play.

- Defensive Play 40, 1st and 10, 13:06
4 receivers set right, screen pass.  JL gets blocked pretty hard by a receiver, throws him away like a rag doll, but the damage is done and the play is over -- 7 yard gain.

- Defensive Play 41, 2nd and 3, 12:28
You need to watch this play on tape to see how lost Laurinaitis is.  Totally bit a terrible play fake.  He does almost get back into the play, but once again, he gets pushed back and it's too late.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-25-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-25.jpg)

- Defensive Play 42, 3rd and 1, 12:12
I don't think I need to tell you which player is upside down in this picture.  First down LSU.  Unbelievable.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-26-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-26.jpg)

- Defensive Play 43, 1st and 10, 11:42
Owned.
The good news is that it wasn't #71.  The bad news is that he was busy pancaking Heyward.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-27-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-27.jpg)

- Defensive Play 44, 2nd and 8, 11:04
JL in coverage.  Intentional grounding Flynn.  Gholston will be missed.

- Defensive Play 45, 3rd and 23, 10:50
Big stop, roughing the punter on Spitler (ironically, Laurinaitis's backup).  Here we go again...

- Defensive Play 46, 1st and 10,  10:33
Run right, good stick by JL!  Solid tackle... but what's this?  Heyward punches someone in the face?  We are now in meltdown mode.  This game is about over.

- Defensive Play 47, 1st and 10,  10:26
No comment.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-28-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-28.jpg)

- Defensive Play 48, 2nd and 1,  9:22
LSU throws away from JL, who is in coverage, and at this point, nobody else on OSU can tackle either.

- Defensive Play 49, 1st and goal,  9:13
This is the play where every defensive back misses the tackle on Doucet and LSU scores/wins the game.

- Defensive Play 50, 1st and 10,  5:46
Incomplete pass.

- Defensive Play 51, 2nd and 10,  5:43
JL can't get off his block, but does manage to get himself pancaked.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-29-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-29.jpg)

- Defensive Play 52, 3rd and 4,  5:07
Laurinaitis beat on a slant again.
[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-30-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-30.jpg)

- Defensive Play 53, 1st and 10,  4:40
JL finally sheds Stewart and helps Grant make the tackle after Coleman misses!  Nice play!

- Defensive Play 54, 2nd and 8,  3:52
Interception Jenkins!!  Are we alive? (Offensive touchdown OSU)

- Defensive Play 55, 1st and 10,  1:31
Flynn gets hammered by Freeman and Jenkins.

- Defensive Play 56, 2nd and 10,  0:50
Doucet sweet, JL behind the rest of traffic.

**Fourth quarter**

- Defensive Play 57, 3rd and 6,  15:00
Flynn runs, JL drops back, another big OSU stop.  Heacock finally figured out that the blitz wasn't working, but it's too little, too late.

- Defensive Play 58, 1st and 10,  10:37
Hester run up the middle for 3.  JL stands straight up, looks timid and tired and is a non-factor in this play.

- Defensive Play 59, 2nd and 7,  10:00
JL gets off his block just in time to jump on the pile.  I wonder how many tackles the book-keepers have at this point.  14?  Because I have about 4.

- Defensive Play 60, 3rd and 4, 9:20
Blitz JL on another pass play, but Heyward bats it down!  Big play!

- Defensive Play 61, 1st and 10, 5:43 (Boeckman interception)
Doucet wimps out and gets chased out of bounds by JL.  Good move stopping the clock #33

- Defensive Play 62, 2nd and 5, 5:37
Another ridiculous Flynn keeper, JL brings him down but he falls forward for 2.

- Defensive Play 63, 3rd and 3, 4:52
Short inside pass to Doucet, JL with a wrestling-style ankle-tackle, stopped short of the first.  I'll take it, but can you please form-tackle someone and stop giving up yards after the initial hit?

- Defensive Play 64, 4th and 1, 4:04
*sigh*  #33 and every other number in scarlet get blown back.  JL is nowhere near this play.

- Defensive Play 65, 1st and 10, 3:40
Run Hester... it's garbage time.

- Defensive Play 66, 2nd and 6, 3:37
The Flynn keeper works!  OSU has given up

- Defensive Play 67, 1st and 10, 3:08
Huge run on Murphy.  JL is burned and misses, but then again, so does everyone else.

- Defensive Play 68, 1st and goal, 2:40
Wait!  JL breaks through on a blitz and is about to DEMOLISH this guy!!!

[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-31a-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-31a.jpg)
Oh, but he falls on his ass instead.  What a playmaker.

[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-31b-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-31b.jpg)
<li>Defensive Play 69, 2nd and goal, 1:56
Another Freeman/Laurinaitis suckfest combo.  It's okay though, USC is all about media hype so they won't even think about tearing into these two overrated guys like LSU did.

[![](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-32-thumb.jpg)](/src/assets/images/OSU_LSU_2008-Laurinaitis_Overrated-32.jpg)

To summarize, I think that Laurinaitis is the most overrated linebacker Ohio State has ever had, and not just because of this miserable game.  This has been going on all season long.  He does not hold a candle to the hard-hitting, smart-playing guys of our past.  He plays on his heels, thinks too much, and does not have that killer instinct.

While I think JL can come back and have a phenomenal 2008, he has things to work on, just like everyone else.  My main point is that he, above all others, does NOT get a free pass for the atrocious performance displayed here, despite the "18" tackles he somehow logged.

This was a terrible 3 hours of my life and I'm glad it's over.

    It amazes me that Mike is evidently smarter than every every NFL scout who said that JL is a top ten pick. Almost every mock draft had him going to New England and we all know how big of an idiot NE&#x27;s head coach is.

    Well, since you aren&#x27;t a coach and don&#x27;t understand the scheme or why certain things work like they do I&#x27;m gonna have to disagree with you. Especially since the NFL said he&#x27;d be a top ten pick. But what do they know?

    hey, numbnuts. every time you point out an LSU O-lineman taking JL out of the play, you are ignoring the fact that our D-tackles weren&#x27;t getting the job done. what are two O-linemen doing 5 yards down field? JL had 18 tackles. he&#x27;s as good as advertised. it was our poor D-line play that cost us.

but that doesn&#x27;t matter, because every dumbass in America with a webpage or a blog is a football expert.

    Which 3 hours were terrible?  The game or the three hours it too to write this post? I am leaning towards the game as this post may have taken considerably longer.

    My favorite part is that these people (ie. Mark Austen) don&#x27;t argue a single point I make, they just go on to regurgitate the same crap that media has been spewing for the past year.  Do you have any of your own thoughts?

Brainwashed indeed.

    He is overrated just like Tebow.  But then again the Big 10 is overrated.  The 2nd best team last year was Illinois and they got waxed in the Rose Bowl.  I like how he gave up 2 TD&#x27;s to the TE.  It is funny.  Keep beating up on those CUPCAKES you 6-1 233lb Coverage MLB.  I like how he gives up a yard or 2 after contact on almost every tackle.  Geno Hayes is a better LB than him.

Also Tressel is OVERRATED.  If it wasn&#x27;t for 6 Turnovers, McGahee getting hurt and the Phantom PASS INTERFERENCE call... He would be 0-3 in National Championship Games.  Be glad the zebra saved his ass.

No I am not a Miami fan but an Arch Rival FSU!!!  Yes I know my team has had its problems you don&#x27;t need to bring it up.

    Reason #23743 that fans from every state in the U.S. besides Ohio hopes that for at least a decade or better yet longer that OSU doesn&#x27;t make it to another BCS title game.  Back to back disasters verses the superior SEC in the MNC are just too painful to watch.  

Let&#x27;s all hope that if the Big Ten does get another team into the MNC game, the sacraficial lamb isn&#x27;t OSU again.

    Roberto, I think you&#x27;re guilty of some negative spin.  I can see your analysis and I don&#x27;t doubt what you show, but you are seeing the game as a bubble around JL.  If there are O-linemen out on JL, then there should be DLmen making plays. . .and there aren&#x27;t.  If I am LSU I am going to key to stop OSU&#x27;s best player and force the rest of the defense to make some plays.  Well. . .as you showed, the rest of the defense did not make plays.  Beyond that, LSU was the best, most balanced offense we say all year.  That is tough on any defense. . .even ours.  Of course, had our offense got a few more first downs and kept the LSU offense of the field a bit more, these defensive mistakes would have been far less magnified.

    Ahh, I love all the traffic coming to this page lately.  Football season is in the air!

I continue to stand by what I said, and JL is still on my radar until proven otherwise.  But this year I will of course be rooting for him and hope he tears the Big Ten and SC up!

Those NFL experts did a great job with Bobby Carpenter too.  Time will tell....  there is much work to do for our big games.

    I am a HUGE buckeye fan--- I succeeded the sophmore-studded Buckeyes in Columbus from 1968-70--you know--Jack Tatum, Mike Sensibaugh, Rex Kern and Jim Stillwagon.  I have said since Lauranitis succeed Hawk for the Buckeyes, that his talent and overall impact were no match for his predecessor.  At least sfive linebackers have played the position better in the intervening three decades.  Lauranitis is out of position on many plays---likes to drop deep and cover wide-outs instead of the tight end over the middle and is virtually a non-factor on draw plays or quick hitters up the middle.  Maybe its partly attributed to Heycock&#x27;s mediocre defensive scheme, but as ESPN analyst and formr Buckeye linebacker stud, hris Spielman noted at the OU fiasco, JL does lack consistent and sustainable intensity.  I have no doubt James is a great young man, but he;s only a good linebacker---and certainly not even close to a Butkus Award winner with his performance thus far this year....

    I dont think you understand what you are talking about sir.  Have you ever played a snap of middle linbacker in your life?  I have, and what it looks like to me is James is doing exactly what he is told to do.  He is leaving the middle open because his assignment is to stop the running back. As seen more clearly in play 25, 2nd quarter.  Maybe if you played at Ohio State, or even on any good team, you would know that.  He jumps on these piles of already made tackles because thats what a great player does, even if the play is dead, you fly to the ball.  You dont stand there and watch and then when the running back breaks free go &quot;oh fuck! I should&#x27;ve been in there!&quot;  You join in and make the play.  People like you piss me off, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about sir.

    Every player has a bad day, you can&#x27;t judge his performance by that game. Just because you probably play in a flag football league doesn&#x27;t mean you get the right to bash the players who have real talent.
And another thing that guy was right about..... &quot; any idiot can write a blog&quot;

    JL is a nice player against inferior talent. The SEC by far the superior football conference and has proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt the past two seasons. LSU wasn;t even supposed to be on the same field with JL and OSU. One day y&#x27;all will learn. GEAUX TIGERS!!!

    Haha... yeah take screen shots of different plays from ONE GAME without examining the offensive scheme or reason for the play.  In any case good attempt but unfortunately you come up short in your argument based on one game.  I break down every Ohio State game for my website and provide video clips to illustrate my points.  Laurinaitis is an excellent linebacker... is he the best of all time at OSU?  Of course not... but he is talented nonetheless.  The only thing that Laurinaitis is guilty of is playing for Ohio State and well everyone loves to have Ohio State these days.
