Before I begin, I'd like to send my condolences out to the family of Dr. David Martin, [who was killed by a great white shark](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-apr-26-me-shark26-story.html) in Solana Beach earlier this week.

I've recently received a good number of concerned messages after Dr. Martin's death, since I've been swimming and surfing a lot lately.  While I appreciate your concern, I am here to publicly state that I am not going to stop swimming or surfing due to fear of sharks.

I understand the risks I take every time I don a black wetsuit and get into the ocean.  The natural marine life, whilst normally shark-free, is part of the fun, adrenaline-pumping process of becoming one with mother nature and her brutal, often unforgiving power.

Let's be clear about it - When you enter the ocean, you become part of the food chain.  And for the first time in your city-dwelling life, you are no longer on top of that chain.

And for that very reason, I don't think it's necessary that we hunt the shark that killed Dr. Martin.  It was hungry and mistook him for a seal.  Deal with it - sharks own the ocean, not us.

If I am killed by a shark while in the ocean, just know that I died while doing something I loved, I was happy as hell, and that I knew the risks that accompanied this endeavor.  I will exercise all caution, and leave the water when I feel unsafe (surfers often get a sixth sense when the water feels eerily "sharky").

See you in the water!

    Dr. David Martin was also killed doing something he loved--interacting w/animals.
