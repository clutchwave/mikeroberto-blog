When moving from one city to another, one should qualify whether or not his supposed wage increase is justified after a comparison of post-tax purchasing power.  The question to ask is, "After taxes, can I live the same standard of living and buy/save more than I could before?"

There are several methods of obtaining this cost-of-living change, such as using the [Consumer Price Index](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/), [House Price Index](http://www.ofheo.gov/HPI.asp), or paying for a more in-depth study like the [ACCRA Cost of Living Index](http://www.coli.org).

This data is great, especially when you want a serious number that includes housing.  But when it comes to the price differences for general "stuff", I call BS on those studies.  Because in the end, the prices change proportionally to one thing -- perhaps the most precious thing -- and that is **cereal**.


And unfortunately, cereal's pretty damned expensive out here.  A box of generic cereal is $2.60 if you're lucky in South Bay.  In Austin, that same box was $2.00.  That's 30% more expensive for a worse product! (not even Kroger brands can top Hill Country Fare)

30%... and that's typically how it goes.  Besides your rent (which costs you 70% more for the same thing) your general "stuff" is going to cost you 30% more.  This includes anything from light bulbs to dry cleaning to computer gear to corn flakes.  Even that $3.00 beer on a Saturday night at your local campus bar?  Yeah, that's $4.00 now.

Which brings me to Life.


So my point is that even when in hostile cereal spending territory, a blind squirrel like you can find a nut.  And not just any nut, but one that contains delectable white sugar lumps and ***nine*** essential vitamins and minerals!

    I don&#x27;t eat breakfast, unless it&#x27;s at noon and involved bacon, eggs and other similarly greasy constituents.  However, I do drink Tropicana Grovestand (preferably with Calcium and Vitamin D added) every morning.  I never look at the price though - since I can&#x27;t live without it, to me it&#x27;s priceless and no cost is too great.  
Have a good time surfin&#x27;,
