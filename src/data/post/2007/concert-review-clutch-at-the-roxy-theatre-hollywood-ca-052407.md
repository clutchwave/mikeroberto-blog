And since you all enjoy rants on opening bands, let me tell you that you will get none complaining about [Year Long Disaster](http://www.yearlongdisaster.com/).  These guys were quite a talented, technical three-piece, and I'd love to see them open again.

So if you were at this show and wanted to hear more old stuff - come back next time.  Neil will be healthy, the setlist will be longer and with an encore, and they'll play a bit of everything.  But with Clutch, we'll take whatever we can get, and odds are, it'll still be one of the best shows you've ever seen.
