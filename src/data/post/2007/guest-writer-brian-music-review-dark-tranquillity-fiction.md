Tonight I've decided to post the first of a few different rants from my friend, Brian.  We often discuss [music](https://www.mikeroberto.com/category/music-reviews/) and [sports](https://www.mikeroberto.com/category/sports/) via e-mail, along with the usual conversations about [Life, The Universe, and Everything](https://www.mikeroberto.com/category/life-the-universe-and-everything/).

Before we get to the review, here's some background.  [Dark Tranquillity](http://www.darktranquillity.com/) is a  melodic death metal band hailing from the death metal capital of the world, Gothenburg, Sweden.  Soon they are releasing their 8th studio album, [Fiction](http://www.amazon.com/Fiction-Dark-Tranquillity/dp/B000NIIUYC/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-0339983-4830263?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1174369178&sr=8-1), and like many other albums, it has leaked onto the net. 

And now, for Brian's take on this album:


They just play it way too safe for me.  They really need to mix it up and try and expand on their sound.  They are the opposite of a sell out thats for certain.  You know exactly what you are going to get with a Dark Tranqullity record.  I feel exhausted after listening to them, 60+ minutes of music that I have tried my best to 'get' but I just don't.  Maybe Im getting old, but there has to be some hook to a song.  Something has to make me want to come back.

*And there you have it.  Thanks Brian!*

    The fact that you dug Blackfield II and not any modern DT album made me think you are a lazy listener (I know Blackfield II ccould be grasped at the very first listen, but there are tons of excellent melodies in recent DT albums).

Try The New Build, Lost to Apathy, Final Resistance, Focus Shift... all are catchy-as-hell.
