In England, there lives a man who writes, performs, and produces some of the most beautiful music in this world.  And practically nobody will ever even hear it.

That man's name is [Steven Wilson]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Wilson).

![](http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/b/ba/180px-Steven_Wilson_tree.jpg)Heavily influenced by Pink Floyd, Wilson has been producing music for over 20 years.  His most popular works are with [Porcupine Tree]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree), Wilson's progressive rock band.  Porcupine Tree's latest albums have come under more influence from the realm of metal; his blending of the two genres is wonderfully unique.

Despite my love for Porcupine Tree, I prefer Wilson's side-project, [Blackfield]( http://www.blackfield.org/).  In Blackfield, Wilson teams up with Aviv Geffen to create a more pop-oriented style of progressive music, and the tandem's chemistry is immediately addictive.

Before I continue, I'd like you to go to my [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/MicroBerto) and listen to the Blackfield MP3 on the playlist (it is currently on the top on auto-play).  This is the intro song to Blackfield II.

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b0/BlackfieldII.jpg/200px-BlackfieldII.jpg)In February of 2007, Blackfield will release their second album, Blackfield II, three years after their original self-titled album.  After just a few listens to this 42 minute long masterpiece, I can already guarantee that this will be in the Top 5 of 2007.

While I was in high school, I listened to a lot of Swedish death metal (I still do).  But [my brother](http://www.myspace.com/NickyRoberto) once asked me, "What do you listen to when you want to chill out?"  It took me nearly a decade to find the respond to that question, Nick, and the answer is Blackfield.

![](http://www.ragazzi-music.de/bilder/blackfield_gr.jpg)Blackfield II might have a bit of pop in it, but the underlying tones are melodically depressing.  Wilson's time-tested methodologies of contemplation and evaluation conjure fantastic mood music.  However dark the album may get, though, I cannot allow Blackfield to do anything but make me happier.  I find it greatly satisfying knowing that there's music so atmospherically beautiful out there, and that I have discovered it, never to let it go.  (Note:  on the left is an image of the cover of the original Blackfield album)

The album gets better and better with every listen.  At times I feel that I have disserviced Blackfield by putting the track "Once" all alone on my MySpace playlist.  This album can't be broken down into songs – one of Wilson's greatest strengths is his ability to make an entire album flow together as if it's one epic song, only to shift like subtle changes of seasons.

[![](http://www.progressiveworld.net/jpg/blackfieldlive3.jpg)](http://www.progressiveworld.net/jpg/blackfieldlive3.jpg)The blend of smooth vocals, electric guitars, and keyboards provide a great foundation for a rollercoaster of an album.  Every song has its ups and downs, and I find it impossible to get bored with it.  I do, however, get lost in this album in ways that I don't experience too often.  Before I know it, I've been sitting here for 42 minutes doing absolutely nothing and the only thing I can remember is that I was listening to some really damned good music.

Whether you're a metalhead looking for an afternoon chill album or a mellow user of psychedelic drugs, I urge you to listen as well.  The album will be available in the states in March of 2007, and in Europe in February.  It can be found [here at amazon.com]( http://www.amazon.com/Blackfield-II/dp/B000MGVA8I), and be sure to check out the video preview of Blackfield II on [blackfield.org](http://www.blackfield.org).

    I absolutely agree with you. I like Porcupine Tree, but I definitely love Blackfield. I discovered them only 2 months ago, but I can&#x27;t stop listen to them. I&#x27;m simply hypnotized by their music, their melodies and their words. I feel so well! I have to drive for a long way every morning to work and I have been listening to Blackfield music for 2 months each morning and each evening... I smile all the way. I feel only positive emotions and I can&#x27;t think negative or be angry with anyone! :) an italian blackfield addicted!
